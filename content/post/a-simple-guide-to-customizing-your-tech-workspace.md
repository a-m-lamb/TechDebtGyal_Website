Although some tech companies are pushing for workers to return to the office, many techies are embracing the work from home lifestyle. However, lifeless home offices can be dispiriting. Re-arranging and refreshing the atmosphere can help liven up the workspace. Why should we ignore our offices when we make time to decorate for holidays?

  

Your workspace should be where your creativity comes to life! When you step in the door, you should be ready to conquer, innovate, connect, and manage. Your home office should be a place where you can be the star of your own show--the CEO in command of your personal universe--the head honcho in charge of your own world.

  

**Here are some tips to get your creative juices flowing and make your home office a space of upliftment and inspiration:**

  

#### **No Matter Your Style, Keep the Clutter Away!**

  

Clutter can sap your energy, so make sure to give everything a place and purpose when designing your workspace. Decorating your home office can help make it inviting while preventing distractions from superfluous items.

  

Consider keeping items stored away neatly, like in labeled folders or on shelves. If you have desk accessories, organize them to avoid an eyesore. Sort out what you need and what you don't--too many knick-knacks can be distracting and make your room feel busy.

  

Organize your desk with drawers, compartments, and baskets for quick access to items like pens, notepads, and other necessities. Work more efficiently with wall organizers and wire baskets, keeping your work area clean and organized.

  

When decorating, choose pieces that are aesthetically pleasing without causing distraction or eye fatigue. Opt for framed art prints or string lights for additional light during late nights.

  

Think of using pieces that also serve as storage. I'm a fan of Japanese lamps for this purpose, since they can offer some extra room to store items and decorations.

  

Your home office should reflect your personal style; however, be mindful of how much time you have to upkeep your workspace. Minimalist designs might be the best option if you're one who struggles to find the time to dust and reorganize often. Maximalist aesthetics look whimsical and beautiful but can become difficult to manage when you're not on top of it.

  

#### **Experiment with Fragrances**

  

Fragrance can influence one's emotions. Invest in some scented candles to establish a relaxing and sophisticated atmosphere. Consider lavender, bergamot, cedarwood, or sandalwood to keep you present. If the workplace has a window, light up a few incense sticks to increase tranquility.

  

Natural oils are also perfect for giving the air around the workspace a gentle yet dynamic smell. But as a candle maker, I like to try different fragrances and spruce up my work area often with different candle scents. Though essential oil diffusers can be just as effective for providing an ambient aroma to the space, candles add an extra je ne sais quoi to set the mood. Whether dark academia or more minimalist design, a candle can truly make it come alive.

  

When it comes to fragrance, remember that less is more—don't go overboard! A single candle or lightly scented essential oil diffuser will be just enough to make your space feel serene and inviting.

  

#### **Bring in Some Greenery**

  

Plants are a great addition to any workspace: they look great and filter out toxins, while providing a calming presence. Low-maintenance options like spider plants, succulents, and bonsai trees require minimal watering and will thrive with indoor lighting.

  

But if you're someone like me who struggles to keep even the hardiest of plants alive, there are plenty of low-maintenance alternatives that can still bring a touch of greenery to your space. Considering they don't require water or sunlight, artificial plants can be perfect for people with a black thumb. You can also go for terrariums or wall gardens made up of preserved moss or succulents—they look beautiful and create an eye-catching display without any upkeep required.

  

#### **Invest In Comfort**

  

Just because the pink swivel chair is cute, doesn't mean you should impulse buy it. Your sitting area in your workspace is more than an accessory. Nobody wants to work with a sore back because their chair is cute but uncomfortable. Unfortunately, furniture that is both comfortable and aesthetically pleasing can be rather pricey, but your back with thank you for the investment in the future.

  

Perhaps it's time to get creative! Have an old chair that's still good for sitting? Then add some chair cushions and voila, you've got yourself a designer look without the designer price tag!

  

#### **Don't Overlook the Perfect Lighting**

Forget ceiling fans! Whether you go for floor lamps or hanging pendants, you can create a cozy yet productive atmosphere in your workspace with the perfect kind of lighting. Consider avoiding those blinding overhead lights — they just add more strain to your eyes.

  

Furthermore, a soft, flickering accent light like a candle can be a great addition to your office. If melting wax under a flame isn't your thing, faux candles or nightlights can bring the same cozy atmosphere. I came across [these really cute mushroom night lights](https://www.amazon.com/Mushroom-AUSAYE-Lights-Children-NightLight/dp/B07CWPP4KM/ref=sxts_rp_s_a_1_0?content-id=amzn1.sym.eff26b9b-e255-411b-a40d-eccb21f93fe4%3Aamzn1.sym.eff26b9b-e255-411b-a40d-eccb21f93fe4&crid=18BVW3H89LDUA&cv_ct_cx=mushroom%2Bnight%2Blight&keywords=mushroom%2Bnight%2Blight&pd_rd_i=B07CWPP4KM&pd_rd_r=023c96ea-8f31-4f3e-95a3-de63bf2ab139&pd_rd_w=fsW5S&pd_rd_wg=4lxAO&pf_rd_p=eff26b9b-e255-411b-a40d-eccb21f93fe4&pf_rd_r=GMT44FMEX9TKR3N7M307&qid=1678083958&sprefix=mushroom%2Bknight%2Bl%2Caps%2C108&sr=1-1-5985efba-8948-4f09-9122-d605505c9d1e&th=1) to give my workspace a more whimsical vibe. They look perfect during those rainy days or nights when you still want to sit in the dark.

  

#### **Find the Right Background Music to Set the Tone**

  

This is a big deal to me. I need background music that makes me feel like I can take over the world. As cringe as it may sound, I listen to Hans Zimmer Dark Knight soundtrack music while at the peak of my focus while programming. Don't be afraid to tap into that main character energy! Discover or build your own dark academia playlists for the times you'll likely be vigorously researching.

  

Maybe you don't care to listen to music, or don't find it very stimulating. There are other soundscapes out there that can help you focus and stay productive. Have you ever heard of natural white noise? It's a type of ambient noise that can help blur out distracting noises and create an environment ideal for concentration.

  

You can find natural white noise recordings online, such as the sound of a crackling fire, rain on your roof or a running stream with bird calls in the background—all of which can be great for studying and wrapping up projects quickly. You may even want to try playing instrumental music at a low volume; sometimes this helps me focus because I'm not distracted by singing vocals.

  

It's all about trial and error, so don't be afraid to try something new! Who knows, it may end up being your new go-to workspace soundtrack!

  

**Remember to put intent and passion into the design of your workspace while updating your workspace as it relates to the shift of the seasons. We don’t forget to decorate our homes as the holidays come and go, but for some reason our office is left neglected. Working from home may give you a greater amount of freedom in regard to design, so why not take advantage of that?**

**Adding some seasonal elements like wallpapers, art pieces, plants or holiday decorations can bring an element of fun and joy into your workspace. Get creative with references from past experiences that may have been special times for you in life. For example, if you had gone away on a beach vacation last summer, display a surfboard or even photos from that trip in your office space.**

**Shifting out old accents and exchanging them for something new often can help keep things fresh and exciting. Incorporate plants that make sense with the season such as tropical plants for summer and evergreen shrubbery for winter months. Consider replacing items like throw pillows or rugs with more appropriate pieces– like florals in spring or tartans in fall – adding a layer of warmth to your space.**

**By taking these steps, you can transform an ordinary home office into one that evokes feelings of joy while providing comfort and motivation during those long hours working remotely.**
