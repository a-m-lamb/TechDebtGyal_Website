The tech industry can be daunting, often evoking feelings of insecurity or questioning one's capacities. This is especially true for women and minorities who may experience even more alienation in this field due to any impolite remarks or animosity they may encounter in their surroundings.

I strive to maintain a sense of autonomy in my relationships with others, rather than attempt to manipulate their behavior. I focus on how I can manage my own thoughts and actions in response to those around me, rather than try to control their decisions. By adopting this attitude, microaggressions will become easier to ignore.

  

In order to be successful as a woman in tech, it's important you keep this advice in mind: always remain true to yourself.

  

At some point, we have to ask ourselves if we really feel as if we're tapping into our full potential at work. I was surrounded by seasoned professionals who had been established in the industry longer than I had been alive.

  

Their sophisticated discourse intimidated and challenged me, but rather than being intimidated by the fact that I was the only woman in the room, I aimed to increase my knowledge of engineering and push my skills further. And there are empowering ways to developing your skillsets beyond aimlessly studying online or solving Hacker Rank problems. Try answering these questions:

  

**1\. What do you do to stay motivated when things get tough?**

  

**2\. Are there any groups you can join or resources you can use to help further your development?**

  

**3\. How can you make yourself an asset in the workplace?**

  

**4\. What steps do you need to take to ensure that your voice is heard in the office?**

  

**5\. Are there any mentors who can help guide and support your progress?**

  

**6\. Is there a way for you to create a safe space for other women and minorities in tech?**

  

**7\. What advice do you have for other women and minorities who are trying to break into the tech field?**

  

**8\. What do you think is the most important skill or trait you need to succeed in tech?**

  

**9\. Are there any organizations or networks that provide resources and connections for women and minorities in the tech industry?**

  

**10\. How can you make sure that your work is seen and appreciated in the workplace?**

  

If you find yourself vexed by these inquiries, then be truthful with yourself and explore roads for your individual evolution. That could be a fantastic point to begin or even revisit.

  

For me, I found myself pivoting away from traditional engineering activities into more creative ones. It was important to find ways to push myself and challenge my skillset, but also make sure I could still contribute to the team in a meaningful way.

  

To do this, I sought out mentorship, took on additional responsibilities outside of engineering (such as content creation or marketing), and explored new outlets for creativity. Additionally, I made sure to network with other minority professionals in tech, attend conferences focused on women in tech, and join diversity groups both online and in-person.

  

These experiences enabled me to create a unique skill set that allowed me stand out as an individual and not just another female engineer. Through these different avenues of growth, I was able to hone my technical proficiency while also developing soft skills that helped foster relationships with my colleagues. Ultimately, this enabled me to gain recognition for the value I provided.

  

By understanding ourselves better and having the courage to explore our unique interests, we can create an established presence within the tech industry that allows us to build our networks and build successful careers on our own terms.
