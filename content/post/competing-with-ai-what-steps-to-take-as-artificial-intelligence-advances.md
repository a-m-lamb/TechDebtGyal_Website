No one needs to be reminded that artificial intelligence (AI) is growing increasingly powerful and intimidating. [Companies such as Wendy's already want to use AI in place of humans to carry out certain tasks](https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/tech/wendys-replace-workers-ai-google.html).

  

Eventually, this could lead to a massive recession in white-collar jobs, leaving many people asking how they can compete with something that never sleeps, never takes a break or requests a raise, and works around the clock. The answer is simply: don't compete. Instead, stay informed of the latest news on AI advancements.

  

At present, developers are still necessary to make sure automated tools like ChatGPT-4 function properly; however, this demand might lessen when the technology develops further in the next five to ten years.

  

So, here's what I anticipate will happen with regards to AI:
------------------------------------------------------------

  

### Front-end developers will start shifting their focus from development to more design focused.

  

Developing creative designs for webpages requires some effort. Anyone can make a website, but to truly capture the attention of the target audience and stand out from the competition, it needs to be interactive and unique.

  

Advancements in AI are making designing custom websites easier than ever before, and soon everyone will need to become proficient prompt engineers in order to complete tasks efficiently. Consequently, programming skills alone won't cut it anymore, so many are signing up for design school courses such as Canva to learn how to design websites, presentations, and more.

  

A great way to kick off your search is by exploring some of the popular websites such as **[Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/), [Designer News](https://www.designernews.co/), and [Designspiration](https://www.designspiration.com/)**.

  

### Back-end developers will shoulder more responsibilities

As a former Java developer, it has become obvious that back-end developers are being asked to do more with less. Staying up-to-date with new languages and technologies is now essential for success in the field, and often I am contacted by employers looking for DevOps or SRE professionals due to my ability to quickly learn and apply new skillsets. This trend appears to be the way of the future for any back-end development position.

  

In addition to requiring a broader understanding of features and services, developers will also be held accountable for the business aspects of their work. They will no longer remain in the background; instead, they will need to make decisions regarding the design, flow, and framework of development and stand out more.

  

I have witnessed several employers prioritize communication skills and a stage presence in their developers, emphasizing the need for them to be able to confidently share ideas with people outside of development. Consequently, I think it is likely that developers will move from introverted tendencies to having an affable and engaging nature.

  

### Scrum Masters Will Be Expected to Utilize AI tools to improve team organization.

  

It is plain to see that Scrum Masters have a lot to gain from the use of Artificial Intelligence. This technology can make ticketing far easier and assist in task management, including bug tracking, backlog grooming, and sprint planning. However, in the next 5-10 years it is likely that this position will become less relevant due to automation.

  

In light of this, Scrum Masters must look towards roles encompassing higher-level activities such as mentoring team members and encouraging creativity within their sprints. Having a strong programming/technical background will be more important to these individuals than ever before.

  

In conclusion,
--------------

  

AI is really capable of weeding out the individuals who don't perform well in their jobs. Those who dedicate themselves to honing their skills and familiarizing themselves with the industry will still do great, but those who have a superficial understanding and view technology simply as a source of income will find it increasingly hard to succeed when their skills can be easily replaced by artificial intelligence.

  

AI encourages us all to tap into our problem-solving capacity - questioning if current practices are best suited for your needs and evaluating new technologies that could help improve your business.

  

We will need to use both critical and creative thinking to come up with solutions while letting AI detect any flaws in these plans and handle technical duties on our behalf.
