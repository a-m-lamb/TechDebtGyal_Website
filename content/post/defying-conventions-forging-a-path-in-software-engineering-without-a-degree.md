This post speaks to those who have a drive for software engineering but do not have a degree in computer science or any associated area. Increasingly, more people are coming to the realization that programming can be learned independently, and a career can be attained by anyone with the diligence to figure it out, even without an academic background in the subject.

I had an interesting conversation with a group of peers on this topic recently. One person was a skilled freelance engineer who dropped out of college nearly two decades ago to enter the industry. Another was a junior developer with a master's degree in computer science who had previously taught at a university. I fell somewhere in between: I paid for higher education but pursued biology and got into tech 3 months after completing a rigorous bootcamp.

  

We all ended up succeeding in tech, but one question kept popping up - does having a degree in computer science increase your chances of excelling tech? Does any degree matter at all?

The seasoned engineer with 20 years of experience flatly stated that having a degree won't make any difference. In fact, his resume doesn't even show an "Education" section. The individual with a master's degree mostly agreed with him.

  

Though it has its perks, going through college for a computer science degree won't magically make someone a good developer. You typically don't learn the most up-to-date tools in tech, but that's precisely what it takes to stay current with the industry. This means many graduates who failed to land internship positions during their time at college struggle to catch up to the cutting edge of the field.

Experience > Education
----------------------

I too am convinced that a computer science degree is a waste of time for the most part. In fact, I've met computer science graduates who couldn't find work in their field because they didn't have the experience needed for success. I even met a woman who struggled to land her first position in tech for a solid 10 years after graduating with her computer science degree.

  

Clearly, it's not the end of the world if you decide to bypass a degree when working in tech. Several of the large Silicon Valley companies, such as Meta, Twitter, Apple, and Google are more likely to evaluate applicants primarily based on their capability rather than their educational background.

  

But keep in mind that many employers still have an older mentality that a degree is fundamental. Even in this case there are tactics one can use to gain employment with these kinds of firms, such as entering through the back door as a consultant.

  

Don't get me wrong, I will say military or large corporate jobs may be more difficult to obtain without holding some type of qualification -- even if it is completely unrelated to the position at hand -- as having that piece of paper tends to come with certain social advantages.

  

For instance, someone with an associate's degree in computer science won't be as appealing to many companies as someone who has earned a bachelor's degree in any subject. I was able to witness this for myself when I was participating in my bootcamp program.

We can see that the degree itself — no matter the subject— is helpful, but simply networking or undergoing reputable programs can help you bypass the troubles you may face if you can't afford to go the higher education route.

Your Network is also Your Net Worth
-----------------------------------

I pressure those new to the tech world to build relationships and foster enthusiasm. Your contacts are truly your greatest asset, as they can offer assistance when the job market becomes unsteady, and you find yourself in need of a position. I still have peers who contact me about potential openings at startups.

  

Moreover, having friends within the industry gives you an insight into what's going on—something that could be useful in deciding which technologies to pursue learning next.

  

So, it all comes down to this: don't unintentionally sever ties. Avoid falling victim to the fleeting connections that come with every new job or title. In fact, you should actively attend tech events to further immerse yourself in the industry so that you're always prepared in a volatile economy. I'm not talking about occasionally sharing posts on LinkedIn or taking up space in a career-focused group, but rather, educating yourself and providing value to a community and people's lives so that real connections are formed. That's how you build bridges that will last through any economic downturn.
