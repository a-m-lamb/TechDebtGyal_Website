It's no surprise that AI is a groundbreaking technology; we can now complete almost all intellectual activities more quickly and efficiently than ever before. But has this made life easier?

  

I thought to myself, "Now I'll have the time to explore passions I couldn't before". And, so far, it's proven to be true. I've gotten into gardening, playing the piano, learning new languages, and digging deeper into philosophy.

  

But in some way, it feels as if I've opened up a can of worms that catapults me in a world where I just wish my brain could process things a little better -- store information a bit more efficiently, be just a tad bit smarter (scratch that, an extra 100 IQ points smarter).

  

AI has highlighted my shortcomings in a way that goes beyond just feeling uncomfortable, it makes me wonder just how prepared we are for the inevitable future where satisfactory work is simply unacceptable, where we all must be able to produce extraordinary works in order to compete with the rapidly shifting world around us.

  

Not only do you have to be a skilled developer, competent at algorithmic problems and completing tasks, but you also must possess a depth of knowledge that encompasses the entire breadth of your field and potentially beyond. You need to be acutely aware of your shortcomings and the limitations of your team's solutions. It's a demanding job, with no room for complacency.

  

A true developer is simply a professional querier and without AI, people had the liberty of having a surface level understanding of the topic at hand, yet in a world where perfection is becoming more achievable than ever, you'll be expected to take in an immense amount of data and ask questions that can make your head feel like it's about to burst.

  

I'm a person who often suffers from deep anxiety, and it makes it hard for me to just "turn off" my worries. I'll be stuck for an entire Sunday afternoon trying to figure out where I need to be in five years so that I don't get replaced by the rapid advances of technology.

  

This industry has never been one that allows you to stay in your comfort zone for too long, but AI is making it necessary to constantly update and hone your skillset more than ever before.

  

AI tools such as ChatGPT might not replace our programming jobs tomorrow, in the next few months, or in the next couple years; but it certainly is possible in the next 5 to 10 years.

  

So, what happens when machines outperform us in tasks? When not even the brightest tech stud in your team can outcompete AIs programming abilities? In this case, it might be best to teach yourself how to find the right answers by asking the right questions.
