"Is it worth becoming a web developer in 2024?" I've been coming across questions such as this all-over social media, from Facebook groups and discord servers to YouTube Videos, many people are pondering this question.

I won't lie, if you're trying to find your place in the world of tech with zero experience in 2024, you're really in for a ride. The competition for tech jobs is intense, as the market is saturated with highly skilled candidates; and there are a few reasons for this:

1\. Companies are utilizing automation to reduce the number of employees they need.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, we all saw this one coming, and regardless of what the hyper-optimistic tech gurus have to say, AI has reduced and will continue to reduce positions in the tech market. This doesn't mean that tech jobs will disappear, only that tech roles will have to evolve. Nowadays, more and more companies are looking for true full-stack developers who have a complete understanding of the development lifecycle.

It's not enough just to be a JavaScript developer; I actually cringe when I see resumes that simply include JavaScript frameworks. Knowing the language is helpful since it's so common, but alone it won't help you stand out in the market. Applications are becoming increasingly abstracted and complex, so resumes need to reflect that an applicant is willing to tackle this reality.

Moreover, the value of proficient communication and interpersonal skills will only increase, so if you think you can get away with not talking to anyone in the industry, you might struggle. Extreme introversion could hold applicants back more than ever in intellectual industries now that AI can automate many intellectually demanding tasks.

2\. Increased competition from overseas markets
-----------------------------------------------

I have encountered this problem firsthand. If an organization does not prioritize security, one is immediately at a disadvantage. As a consultant, it's quite common to come across projects assigned to international teams instead of teams in the US.

Besides a company's moral obligation to support American developers, there is nothing restricting them from hiring overseas teams with leads costing significantly less than junior developers. This has been a pressing concern long before the recent AI boom, but this issue has now become more apparent due to the mentioned increase in AI utilization.

3\. Difficulty staying up to date in the constant changes in technology.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have already touched on this, but to further emphasize it -- many people have resumes that are too thin. While having advanced Java skills and being able to build microservices might have been enough even months ago, companies are now looking for more. In this market, do not heed anyone who tells you to specialize.

I have networked with many experienced developers who are always looking to upgrade their skill set, and they're constantly searching for the latest in-demand technologies in order to stay relevant -- far beyond their current job title. You should become familiar with cloud and integration tools other than what you use professionally.

In this market, you might know and use each skill listed in a job posting, but interviewers will now ask what else you know beyond those skills because the person who gets the job is the one curious enough to take the initiative of learning more than necessary and thus providing more value. There are so many people who have been laid off and perfectly fit a role posted on Indeed, that companies can now demand more from applicants in order to make an easier decision.

The chances are high that a migration will be necessary or an unexpected addition to the application architecture will be required and a resume showing that you just want to remain within your comfort zone will only harm you.

**So, is it worthwhile to become a developer in 2024? If you're entering the field expecting an easy ride with no need to socialize, 6-figures without additional effort, and job security, you may want to rethink your decision. But then again, what else can you expect?**
