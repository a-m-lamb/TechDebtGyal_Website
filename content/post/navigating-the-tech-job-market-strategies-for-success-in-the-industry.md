Welcome to this Free Job-Hunting Workshop! After graduating with a degree in biology, I realized that I wanted to make more money than what lab techs make and decided to do something about it. I went through a bootcamp that transformed me into a Java Full-stack developer, and now I'm here to show you guys how to get your foot in the door of the tech industry.

It's no secret that the current workplace climate is not ideal by any means. Before the mass layoffs, companies have been outsourcing to foreign countries, where they can hire skilled senior developers who are much more affordable than even junior developers in the United States. Furthermore, AI automation is taking on a larger role in code development, which further reduces job opportunities for junior developers. Things aren't looking great during the holiday season, either - with employees taking time off and businesses typically winding down operations around this time of year. All of these factors create an incredibly competitive job market.

To stay ahead of the competition, here are 4 simple steps you should take. These tasks may sound straightforward, but there are still plenty of people who need help in each area. This isn't just for junior developers trying to break into the tech industry either; most experienced professionals also need to pay attention to these tactics if they want to keep their foothold in the industry. After all, even if the tech job market was booming, it's never too late to improve your strategies.

1\. Polish that GitHub Profile
------------------------------

My first point to emphasize --especially for inexperienced junior developers-- is the importance of a polished GitHub profile. I've seen countless people in group chats who're complaining about not getting hired yet have no activity on their GitHub accounts. Trust me: when I passed interviews, my GitHub account was scrutinized, and I could tell it gave me an edge over the other applicants. With GitHub you can display your coding skills while at the same time developing new ones. It's a great versioning tool that comes particularly handy with private projects, revealing how passionate you are about programming just from glancing at your history. Additionally, if you're new to working in teams, you can look up open-source projects on GitHub to contribute to and get involved in. Not only do you learn loads this way, but you also expand your networks for potential endorsements on LinkedIn or even job offers from those you've been working with.

2\. Learn How to Network
------------------------

Now, let's discuss the concept of networking. Networking involves creating and nurturing connections with people in your professional and social circles to swap information, support, and opportunities. Emphasis should be placed on 'creating and maintaining relationships' as this is often the area where most people fail when it comes to networking. Just attending networking events doesn't guarantee a job offer, and keep in mind that there are several other advantages associated with networking apart from obtaining a job. Networking allows you to build your network further for potential future business partnerships or projects. You gain unique industry knowledge that you might not have had access to if you are limited to what you're exposed to at your full-time job. Even among those who work in a similar field, they can use different technologies which could help broaden your expertise. Most importantly, networking g gives you the opportunity to learn how to communicate properly with others. Artificial Intelligence has taken over a lot of tasks in the tech industry, meaning employers are now looking for people who can go beyond what an AI system can manage and communicate complex topics and solutions to others. Gone are the days where introverts could comfortably remain hidden behind their computers; networking is now essential for success within this career path. **Here are five strategies that can help you maximize your networking abilities:**

**Attend Relevant Conferences and Events:** If you want to get ahead in the industry, one of the most important steps is to attend conferences, workshops, and seminars that involve people in the same field. This way, you can learn more about upcoming trends, exchange knowledge with experts in the area, and even create valuable connections.

**Maximize Online Opportunities:** Social media has become one of the most powerful tools for numerous activities, and networking is no exception. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., provide various opportunities to engage with professionals from all over the world. Joining online forums, writing blogs, or commenting on posts related to your niche are also great methods to increase your visibility in the industry.

**Get Involved in Volunteering Initiatives:** To give back to society as well as invest in your own growth, opting for community service projects or other activities relevant to your industry will help you expand your network by connecting with new people who also share a passion for what they do.

**Set Up Informational Interviews:** This type of job-seeking opportunity allows you to meet experienced professionals in your field and establish valuable relationships with them while learning and gaining insight about different aspects of their experience. You might also find that some of these contacts could be interested in hiring you at some point.

**Enroll in Bootcamps and Workshops:** Whether you are just starting out or have some experience under your belt already, enrolling in educational bootcamps and workshops is an effective method that offers not only invaluable industry-specific knowledge but also access to a lot of alumni who can serve as excellent resources for networking later on. Furthermore, many of these bootcamps partner with companies so their graduates can work for them as junior developers.

Networking is a valuable skill that many people overlook. In order to create meaningful connections, it's essential to be genuine and show interest in others. Start by actively listening--pay attention to the person's story, ask questions, and take an interest in what they have to say. Then, be willing to offer your assistance if applicable. Show that you are sincere about wanting to help and engage in a mutually beneficial exchange. Finally, make sure to follow up with contacts you've made and thank them for their time. This way, you'll keep those relationships alive and growing.

Paul Theroux uttered the truest of words when he said: "Gain a modest reputation for being unreliable and you will never be asked to do a thing.” We must maintain our credibility by keeping promises, and if we are unable to meet expectations, it is important to communicate this clearly and concisely. Networking also entails offering value to others as well as seeking assistance; transactions should not be one-sided or focused solely on obtaining favors. If we apply these principles, it can prevent us from falling into some common pitfalls such as neglecting follow-ups or failing to offer value in return for requests made.

The main idea is that if you stay true to yourself, you may have success when networking. It's common for people to just send out resumes and join groups without actually engaging. Before reaching out to others, ask yourself why they would want to help you in the first place. Taking some time for self-reflection can go a long way in getting doors opened up for you. If you stick to the tips I've outlined above, many opportunities might come your way.

3\. Get into Blogging:
----------------------

Another way to make a name for yourself would be to start blogging. Writing about the solutions you found to particular issues in the industry can show your expertise and authority in the field, as well as highlight any problems that still need more research. It's like keeping your own professional journal, but it has the potential to help others in the same industry. You might even be able to generate an income from it once you become active enough.

4\. Find A Great Mentor:
------------------------

The final point for improving your job-hunting experience is by securing yourself a great mentor, keep this rule of thumb in mind: It's best to find a mentor outside of your workplace. Transparency while working with a mentor is essential, and this helps ensure that as a mentee, you won't put yourself at risk by talking about side projects and job pivots at work. At the same time, remain open-minded to mentors inside your company if they possess underlying qualities such as trustworthiness and reliability. In addition, look for mentors who demonstrate characteristics like active listening, effective communication, supportiveness/empathy, commitment and availability. Also seek mentors who are experienced and can challenge and encourage you while keeping your goals top priority. Finally, select someone who can be a positive role model in terms of offering constructive feedback so that you can reach new heights in success.

If you're looking to be guided on your career path, inspiring mentors are essential. To find the right mentor, you must do your research; take a few minutes to google and vet them via LinkedIn – it will save you time in the long run since any unqualified “mentors” who ask for compensation should be avoided. Most importantly, remember that no single mentor can provide all of the answers – try and build a team of mentors tailored to your specific needs. Networking events or social media groups are great places to reach out and introduce yourself – just make sure you have something to contribute in terms of value if you're asking for help.

When interacting with potential mentors, ensure that you possess all the qualities of a great mentee. These include openness, respect, initiative, responsiveness, curiosity, adaptability, self-reflection, feedback receptiveness, follow-through professionalism, and appreciation.

**In conclusion, navigating the tech job market requires a multifaceted approach that includes technical prowess, networking finesse, and mentorship. By enhancing your GitHub profile, engaging in active networking, maintaining authenticity, contributing through blogging, and seeking mentorship, you not only improve your chances of securing a job but also elevate your professional profile within the industry. The evolving nature of the tech sector demands continuous growth and adaptation, making it imperative to stay proactive in honing your skills, building relationships, and seeking guidance from experienced mentors. Embracing these strategies will undoubtedly place you in a more advantageous position in the competitive landscape of the tech job market.**
