Its simplicity and ease of use make it an ideal choice for a wide range of projects. While I wouldn't call myself a Python master, I've found it incredibly handy for quickly scripting tasks and building bots on the go.\nIn this tutorial, I'll walk you through creating a Python bot using Selenium. If you're unfamiliar, Selenium is a powerful browser automation tool that's perfect for web scraping and testing.\nBut before we dive into the code, let me share some thoughts. If you've been considering Selenium for your projects, I recently wrote a blog post on browser automation with Golang that you might find interesting.\nNow, let's get down to business. In this tutorial, we'll focus on building a Python bot that scrapes tech articles from Google News and emails them to you using the Gmail API.\nBefore we start coding, here's what you'll need:\nPython installed on your system.\nSelenium library installed (pip install selenium).\nChrome WebDriver installed.\nGmail API set up with credentials.\nBasic knowledge of Python.\nLet’s also take not of the versions of this software that I’ve been utilizing.\nPython 3.12.3​ pip 24.0 In today's fast-paced world, staying updated with the latest tech news is crucial. But who has the time to browse through countless articles? That's where our Python bot comes in.\nThis bot will scrape tech articles from Google News, compile them, and send them to your inbox. We'll cover everything from setting up Selenium to sending emails using the Gmail API.\nNow, let's walk through the code. And if you need to do any copy and past action, no worries! You can pull from my repo here (https://github.com/a-m-lamb/Into_to_Python).\nWhat is Selenium? Selenium is a popular browser automation tool used for testing web applications. It allows you to interact with web elements and perform actions like clicking buttons and entering text.\nSetting Up the Environment First, we'll import the necessary libraries:\n1 2from selenium import webdriver 3 4import time 5 6from gmail import gmail_authenticate, send_message Next, we'll initialize the Chrome WebDriver and navigate to Google News:\n1 2driver = webdriver.Chrome() 3 4driver.get(\u0026#39;https://news.google.com/search?q=programming\u0026#39;) 5 6time.sleep(2) 7 8driver.maximize_window() Be sure to add your unzipped driver file in the root of your project while also ensuring you’re utilizing the driver that corresponds with both the browser type (e.g.: Firefox or Chrome) and the version of the browser. If the versions don’t match, the error in the command prompt will point you in the right direction.\nScraping Articles We'll extract URLs of articles from the Google News page:\n1 2article_urls = [] 3 4for x in range(1, 4): 5 6 element = driver.find_element(\u0026#39;xpath\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;//*[@id=\u0026#34;yDmH0d\u0026#34;]/c-wiz/div/main/div[2]/c-wiz/c-wiz[\u0026#39;+str(x)+\u0026#39;]/c-wiz/article/div[1]/div[1]/a\u0026#39;) 7 8 url = element.get_attribute(\u0026#34;href\u0026#34;) 9 10 article_urls.append(url) Next, we'll fetch article content and store it:\n1 2articles_content = [] 3 4for url in article_urls: 5 6 driver.get(url) 7 8 time.sleep(2) 9 10 c = build_dictionary(url) 11 12 articles_content.append(c) Sending Email Finally, we'll compose an email and send it using Gmail API. Check out this article to get the necessary steps configured (configuration.json + Gnail API ) before making the Gmail authentication calls.

After graduating with a degree in biology, I realized that I wanted to make more money than what lab techs make and decided to do something about it. I went through a bootcamp that transformed me into a Java Full-stack developer, and now I'm here to show you guys how to get your foot in the door of the tech industry.\nIt's no secret that the current workplace climate is not ideal by any means. Before the mass layoffs, companies have been outsourcing to foreign countries, where they can hire skilled senior developers who are much more affordable than even junior developers in the United States. Furthermore, AI automation is taking on a larger role in code development, which further reduces job opportunities for junior developers. Things aren't looking great during the holiday season, either - with employees taking time off and businesses typically winding down operations around this time of year. All of these factors create an incredibly competitive job market.\nTo stay ahead of the competition, here are 4 simple steps you should take. These tasks may sound straightforward, but there are still plenty of people who need help in each area. This isn't just for junior developers trying to break into the tech industry either; most experienced professionals also need to pay attention to these tactics if they want to keep their foothold in the industry. After all, even if the tech job market was booming, it's never too late to improve your strategies.\n1. Polish that GitHub Profile My first point to emphasize --especially for inexperienced junior developers-- is the importance of a polished GitHub profile. I've seen countless people in group chats who're complaining about not getting hired yet have no activity on their GitHub accounts. Trust me: when I passed interviews, my GitHub account was scrutinized, and I could tell it gave me an edge over the other applicants. With GitHub you can display your coding skills while at the same time developing new ones. It's a great versioning tool that comes particularly handy with private projects, revealing how passionate you are about programming just from glancing at your history. Additionally, if you're new to working in teams, you can look up open-source projects on GitHub to contribute to and get involved in. Not only do you learn loads this way, but you also expand your networks for potential endorsements on LinkedIn or even job offers from those you've been working with.\n2. Learn How to Network Now, let's discuss the concept of networking. Networking involves creating and nurturing connections with people in your professional and social circles to swap information, support, and opportunities. Emphasis should be placed on 'creating and maintaining relationships' as this is often the area where most people fail when it comes to networking. Just attending networking events doesn't guarantee a job offer, and keep in mind that there are several other advantages associated with networking apart from obtaining a job. Networking allows you to build your network further for potential future business partnerships or projects. You gain unique industry knowledge that you might not have had access to if you are limited to what you're exposed to at your full-time job. Even among those who work in a similar field, they can use different technologies which could help broaden your expertise. Most importantly, networking g gives you the opportunity to learn how to communicate properly with others. Artificial Intelligence has taken over a lot of tasks in the tech industry, meaning employers are now looking for people who can go beyond what an AI system can manage and communicate complex topics and solutions to others. Gone are the days where introverts could comfortably remain hidden behind their computers; networking is now essential for success within this career path. Here are five strategies that can help you maximize your networking abilities:\nAttend Relevant Conferences and Events: If you want to get ahead in the industry, one of the most important steps is to attend conferences, workshops, and seminars that involve people in the same field. This way, you can learn more about upcoming trends, exchange knowledge with experts in the area, and even create valuable connections.\nMaximize Online Opportunities: Social media has become one of the most powerful tools for numerous activities, and networking is no exception. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., provide various opportunities to engage with professionals from all over the world. Joining online forums, writing blogs, or commenting on posts related to your niche are also great methods to increase your visibility in the industry.\nGet Involved in Volunteering Initiatives: To give back to society as well as invest in your own growth, opting for community service projects or other activities relevant to your industry will help you expand your network by connecting with new people who also share a passion for what they do.\nSet Up Informational Interviews: This type of job-seeking opportunity allows you to meet experienced professionals in your field and establish valuable relationships with them while learning and gaining insight about different aspects of their experience. You might also find that some of these contacts could be interested in hiring you at some point.\nEnroll in Bootcamps and Workshops: Whether you are just starting out or have some experience under your belt already, enrolling in educational bootcamps and workshops is an effective method that offers not only invaluable industry-specific knowledge but also access to a lot of alumni who can serve as excellent resources for networking later on. Furthermore, many of these bootcamps partner with companies so their graduates can work for them as junior developers.\nNetworking is a valuable skill that many people overlook. In order to create meaningful connections, it's essential to be genuine and show interest in others. Start by actively listening--pay attention to the person's story, ask questions, and take an interest in what they have to say. Then, be willing to offer your assistance if applicable. Show that you are sincere about wanting to help and engage in a mutually beneficial exchange. Finally, make sure to follow up with contacts you've made and thank them for their time. This way, you'll keep those relationships alive and growing.\nPaul Theroux uttered the truest of words when he said: \u0026quot;Gain a modest reputation for being unreliable and you will never be asked to do a thing.” We must maintain our credibility by keeping promises, and if we are unable to meet expectations, it is important to communicate this clearly and concisely. Networking also entails offering value to others as well as seeking assistance; transactions should not be one-sided or focused solely on obtaining favors. If we apply these principles, it can prevent us from falling into some common pitfalls such as neglecting follow-ups or failing to offer value in return for requests made.\nThe main idea is that if you stay true to yourself, you may have success when networking. It's common for people to just send out resumes and join groups without actually engaging. Before reaching out to others, ask yourself why they would want to help you in the first place. Taking some time for self-reflection can go a long way in getting doors opened up for you. If you stick to the tips I've outlined above, many opportunities might come your way.\n3. Get into Blogging: Another way to make a name for yourself would be to start blogging. Writing about the solutions you found to particular issues in the industry can show your expertise and authority in the field, as well as highlight any problems that still need more research. It's like keeping your own professional journal, but it has the potential to help others in the same industry. You might even be able to generate an income from it once you become active enough.\n4. Find A Great Mentor: The final point for improving your job-hunting experience is by securing yourself a great mentor, keep this rule of thumb in mind: It's best to find a mentor outside of your workplace. Transparency while working with a mentor is essential, and this helps ensure that as a mentee, you won't put yourself at risk by talking about side projects and job pivots at work. At the same time, remain open-minded to mentors inside your company if they possess underlying qualities such as trustworthiness and reliability. In addition, look for mentors who demonstrate characteristics like active listening, effective communication, supportiveness/empathy, commitment and availability. Also seek mentors who are experienced and can challenge and encourage you while keeping your goals top priority. Finally, select someone who can be a positive role model in terms of offering constructive feedback so that you can reach new heights in success.\nIf you're looking to be guided on your career path, inspiring mentors are essential. To find the right mentor, you must do your research; take a few minutes to google and vet them via LinkedIn – it will save you time in the long run since any unqualified “mentors” who ask for compensation should be avoided. Most importantly, remember that no single mentor can provide all of the answers – try and build a team of mentors tailored to your specific needs. Networking events or social media groups are great places to reach out and introduce yourself – just make sure you have something to contribute in terms of value if you're asking for help.\nWhen interacting with potential mentors, ensure that you possess all the qualities of a great mentee. These include openness, respect, initiative, responsiveness, curiosity, adaptability, self-reflection, feedback receptiveness, follow-through professionalism, and appreciation.\nIn conclusion, navigating the tech job market requires a multifaceted approach that includes technical prowess, networking finesse, and mentorship. By enhancing your GitHub profile, engaging in active networking, maintaining authenticity, contributing through blogging, and seeking mentorship, you not only improve your chances of securing a job but also elevate your professional profile within the industry. The evolving nature of the tech sector demands continuous growth and adaptation, making it imperative to stay proactive in honing your skills, building relationships, and seeking guidance from experienced mentors. Embracing these strategies will undoubtedly place you in a more advantageous position in the competitive landscape of the tech job market.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/11/navigating-tech-job-market-strategies.html","section":"post","tags":["Career Development"],"title":"Navigating the Tech Job Market: Strategies for Success in the Industry"},{"body":"\r\u0026quot;Is it worth becoming a web developer in 2024?\u0026quot; I've been coming across questions such as this all-over social media, from Facebook groups and discord servers to YouTube Videos, many people are pondering this question.\nI won't lie, if you're trying to find your place in the world of tech with zero experience in 2024, you're really in for a ride. The competition for tech jobs is intense, as the market is saturated with highly skilled candidates; and there are a few reasons for this:\n1. Companies are utilizing automation to reduce the number of employees they need. So, we all saw this one coming, and regardless of what the hyper-optimistic tech gurus have to say, AI has reduced and will continue to reduce positions in the tech market. This doesn't mean that tech jobs will disappear, only that tech roles will have to evolve. Nowadays, more and more companies are looking for true full-stack developers who have a complete understanding of the development lifecycle.\nIt's not enough just to be a JavaScript developer; I actually cringe when I see resumes that simply include JavaScript frameworks. Knowing the language is helpful since it's so common, but alone it won't help you stand out in the market. Applications are becoming increasingly abstracted and complex, so resumes need to reflect that an applicant is willing to tackle this reality.\nMoreover, the value of proficient communication and interpersonal skills will only increase, so if you think you can get away with not talking to anyone in the industry, you might struggle. Extreme introversion could hold applicants back more than ever in intellectual industries now that AI can automate many intellectually demanding tasks.\n2. Increased competition from overseas markets I have encountered this problem firsthand. If an organization does not prioritize security, one is immediately at a disadvantage. As a consultant, it's quite common to come across projects assigned to international teams instead of teams in the US.\nBesides a company's moral obligation to support American developers, there is nothing restricting them from hiring overseas teams with leads costing significantly less than junior developers. This has been a pressing concern long before the recent AI boom, but this issue has now become more apparent due to the mentioned increase in AI utilization.\n3. Difficulty staying up to date in the constant changes in technology. I have already touched on this, but to further emphasize it -- many people have resumes that are too thin. While having advanced Java skills and being able to build microservices might have been enough even months ago, companies are now looking for more. In this market, do not heed anyone who tells you to specialize.\nI have networked with many experienced developers who are always looking to upgrade their skill set, and they're constantly searching for the latest in-demand technologies in order to stay relevant -- far beyond their current job title. You should become familiar with cloud and integration tools other than what you use professionally.\nIn this market, you might know and use each skill listed in a job posting, but interviewers will now ask what else you know beyond those skills because the person who gets the job is the one curious enough to take the initiative of learning more than necessary and thus providing more value. There are so many people who have been laid off and perfectly fit a role posted on Indeed, that companies can now demand more from applicants in order to make an easier decision.\nThe chances are high that a migration will be necessary or an unexpected addition to the application architecture will be required and a resume showing that you just want to remain within your comfort zone will only harm you.\nSo, is it worthwhile to become a developer in 2024? If you're entering the field expecting an easy ride with no need to socialize, 6-figures without additional effort, and job security, you may want to rethink your decision. But then again, what else can you expect?\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/11/is-it-worth-becoming-web-developer-in.html","section":"post","tags":["Career Development"],"title":"Is it Worth Becoming a Web Developer in 2024? "},{"body":" I noticed that many of us don't seem to have a sound understanding of blockchain and its associated technologies. As a programmer in the financial tech sector, I must admit that my knowledge of blockchain and crypto was only superficial. We could all name bitcoin and NFTs, but most people aren't well informed about the reasons why blockchain is an essential tech trend. That's why this article is being written to explain what makes blockchain so important and why YOU should look into it beyond digital currencies and non-fungible tokens.\nBlockchain is like a Global Computer Think of it this way: your computer is not connected to the internet. Let's assume you have no Wi-Fi/internet connection, but you might have preinstalled applications like games and Microsoft Word, as well as other essential documents. Unless somebody else is signed in on your device, you are the sole user with all of the information stored only on your PC, nowhere else.\nWhen you log into Web2, your computer is connected to a server that stores all of your user info and data. These are linked to a database which is controlled by a central entity with access to your information. This authority can do whatever they want with your data, which might be sold without your consent across the web. In addition, any outsider capable of hacking it has the power to modify your data stored online. Large cases of this have been seen in banks and various applications leading to huge financial losses due to security vulnerabilities (I would highly advise you look into common OWASP vulnerabilities if you want to learn more about this).\nAnother problem is that the info in these databases may not even be \u0026quot;real\u0026quot;. Using the banks as an example, what happens if the economy takes a downturn, and the institution isn't able to give you your money back when you ask for it? The data in such a situation definitely won't be dependable or trustworthy. We've seen this kind of thing happen before, like during the time of the Great Depression, when bank customers hurried to close their accounts in fear; or in China, where entire villages experienced bank runs; or in San Francisco with the First Republic Bank collapse.\nSo, what blockchain does is it solves an essential problem in the system: trust. Blockchain is like a worldwide computer because you have an account and communicate with a blockchain node instead of a webserver. It is different from the latter in that it has multiple nodes, each with a copy of your user information. What also sets it apart is that a single account connects to the entire system, as compared to Web2.0, which requires multiple accounts for services such as Facebook, Instagram, Wells Fargo, Discord, etc. In contrast, Web3.0 only needs one.\nIt's important to point out that blockchain technology is a distributed database with information spread across multiple nodes. Every node functions as its own computer, running programs tailored for data sharing. Indeed, all transactions done on the blockchain are documented in the network's history and can be seen by anyone—assuming they have access to the right wallet. To ensure safety and security when handling digital assets, users must connect to an authorized node through their blockchain wallet. Different networks and wallets may require specific methods to make this connection.\nAfter these transactions have occurred, the algorithm for the consensus mechanism is set into motion to authenticate the transaction. This means that various nodes interact with each other to confirm the data in the transaction simultaneously. Your data's authenticity is guaranteed by this process instead of relying on just one node to store your transaction details. After consensus has been attained, and the transaction validated, you can observe your updated transaction/information, whether it's receiving cryptocurrency, a change in balances, or some interaction with a decentralized application (DApps).\nSo, why is this important to know? The demand for blockchain developers is on the rise, and it's no surprise as to why. The primary factor driving the need for blockchain developers is the increasing number of blockchain applications being developed. This means more projects are available to those who have a strong understanding of the technology and can develop, code, and deploy applications on it.\nAdditionally, companies that are utilizing blockchain technology want experienced professionals as this technology is still relatively new and complex in comparison to other database technologies. With that being said, now is the perfect time for you to brush up those coding skills if you’re looking for a job in this field.\nMoreover, it’s important to remember that the development process for a blockchain application is unlike any other tech stack because of its unique components and features. You must understand consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, hash algorithms, data structures, authentication protocols, and cryptography. All these elements are not part of a traditional tech stack but essential when working with a blockchain-based application.\nFinally, having an understanding of existing applications can help you get ahead in the industry. Learning about different projects or initiatives can help give your resume a boost when employers are reviewing potential candidates. You may also be able to score potential jobs by showcasing your experience with existing projects or initiatives within the space.\nSo, if you understand blockchain concepts, now is the perfect time for you to get involved in this rapidly expanding industry. With the right skills, you may even become the next great tech mogul and make a fortune by investing in new technologies while they are still fresh.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/09/how-blockchain-is-revolutionizing.html","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"How Blockchain is Revolutionizing Industries and Transforming the Future"},{"body":"\rHave you ever found yourself wrestling with Google Sheets, trying to organize and manipulate data to meet your specific needs? The world of programming isn't limited to lines of code and algorithms; it's a gateway to enhancing efficiency and innovation across diverse professions. While many people are familiar with writing custom functions for Excel, did you know that you can also achieve this level of customization with Google Sheets? Welcome to the world of Google Apps Script – an extension of Google Sheets that empowers you to create tailored custom functions and unlock a realm of possibilities.\nAt its core, Google Apps Script is akin to a subset of JavaScript, tailored to interact seamlessly with Google services and APIs. While the language shares similarities with JavaScript, it offers specialized methods designed to work harmoniously with Google's suite of tools. This integration enables you to craft functions that cater to your unique data challenges.\nOne striking feature of Google Apps Script is its documentation, which provides clear guidance to help you dive into this realm of customization. Let's take a closer look at how you can leverage the power of Google Apps Script to create and implement custom functions.\nGetting Started: Creating a Custom Function 1. Create a Spreadsheet: Begin by opening a new Google Spreadsheet. Once inside, navigate to the menu items and select Extensions \u0026gt; Apps Script.\n2. Paste Your Function: In the Apps Script editor, you can start crafting your custom function. To illustrate, consider a scenario where you wish to calculate the sale price of an item after applying a discount. Here's an example function that accomplishes this:\n/** * Calculates the sale price of a value at a given discount. * The sale price is formatted as US dollars. * @param {number} input The value to discount. * @param {number} discount The discount to apply, such as .5 or 50%. * @return The sale price formatted as USD. * @customfunction */\nfunction SalePrice(input, discount) { let price = input - (input * discount); let dollarUS = Intl.NumberFormat(\u0026quot;en-US\u0026quot;, { style: \u0026quot;currency\u0026quot;, currency: \u0026quot;USD\u0026quot;, }); return dollarUS.format(price); }\nA noteworthy detail is that function names are case-sensitive.

There's an oversaturation of JavaScript developers in the market. The tech industry is experiencing an overflow of web developers, particularly in the realm of JavaScript. While JavaScript remains a powerhouse language, the saturation of JavaScript developers has prompted aspiring tech professionals to consider alternative programming languages as a means to stand out in a crowded market.\nIn this article, we will explore the implications of the oversaturation of JavaScript developers and shed light on alternative languages that can offer unique opportunities and avenues for success. By diversifying their skill sets and considering alternative languages, developers can differentiate themselves and uncover exciting career prospects.\nThe Landscape of JavaScript Saturation To understand the impact of the oversaturation of JavaScript developers, it is essential to examine the current landscape of the tech industry.\nJavaScript has gained immense popularity due to its versatility, making it a staple language for web development. As a result, the market has become saturated with JavaScript developers, leading to increased competition and challenges for newcomers to make their mark.\nThis saturation has created a demand for developers who can bring something different to the table, leading many to explore alternative programming languages as a strategic career move.\nExploring Alternative Programming Languages Python: Known for its simplicity and readability, Python has gained widespread adoption in areas such as data science, machine learning, and backend development. Its extensive libraries and frameworks make it a powerful tool for various applications.\nRuby: Ruby's elegant syntax and focus on developer happiness have made it a favorite among web developers. It is commonly used with the Ruby on Rails framework, enabling rapid development of web applications.\nJava: Java is often seen as overly complicated and verbose, yet it still dominates enterprise development. It is ubiquitous in large companies that need individuals to maintain legacy systems. Moreover, its noteworthy performance makes it great for Android applications and larger-scale enterprise programs. Plus, the Java community remains active and supportive.\nGo: Go (or Golang) has gained popularity for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming. It excels in areas like networking, distributed systems, and microservices architecture.\nThe Benefits of Embracing Alternative Languages: Niche Opportunities When you diversify your skillsets, you gain the opportunity of uncovering niche opportunities in the market. This not only leads to increased job security since you're practically indispensable, but you can also demand higher pay.\nCompanies are looking for professionals who are willing to go beyond the traditional and explore different areas in order to stay ahead of the competition.\nMoreover, having experience with multiple or unique programming languages allows developers to switch roles or take on more complex projects without needing extensive training. This gives them more freedom within their current role and enables them to work on innovative projects they wouldn’t be able if they hyper-rely on mainstream languages such as JavaScript.\nAccess to Specific Tools and Frameworks: By mastering multiple languages, you open yourself up to new techniques and software that are exclusive to each language. Every programming language has its own set of libraries, frameworks, and tools. Going beyond JavaScript to other languages provides more resources and solutions to any technical obstacle.\nHaving a grasp of these tools is not just beneficial, but imperative for your resume. Employers are constantly on the lookout for individuals with knowledge of highly specific frameworks. In fact, I would argue that most companies prioritize knowledge of frameworks over programming languages themselves since having expertise in the framework often means you already know the language it's built upon.\nIn-Demand Domains: Certain programming languages are more suited to certain applications. For example, if you're a big data engineer, Scala may be necessary for your job. On the other hand, if you work in embedded engineering, Python, C++, Rust and Go might be better options.\nWhen I was a big data engineer, having an excellent understanding of Scala was key; other than that, however, I haven't needed to use it since. Therefore, focus on the industries that you're passionate about and invest time in learning the languages and frameworks associated with them to expand your chances of entering those fields.\nThe oversaturation of JavaScript developers in the tech industry calls for innovative approaches to stand out and thrive. Exploring alternative programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, and Go can open doors to unique opportunities and help developers carve their niche in the market. By diversifying their skill sets and embracing these alternative languages, developers can differentiate themselves, gain a competitive edge, and tap into specialized domains where their expertise is highly sought after. While JavaScript continues to be valuable, venturing beyond it expands horizons and equips developers with the tools and knowledge to tackle a broader range of projects. By navigating the overflow of web developers and embracing alternative languages, tech professionals can chart their path to success in a thriving and ever-evolving industry.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/07/navigating-javascript-developer.html","section":"post","tags":["JavaScript","Front-end Development","Career Development"],"title":"Navigating the JavaScript Developer Overflow: Exploring Opportunities in an Oversaturated Tech Industry"},{"body":"\rThis post speaks to those who have a drive for software engineering but do not have a degree in computer science or any associated area. Increasingly, more people are coming to the realization that programming can be learned independently, and a career can be attained by anyone with the diligence to figure it out, even without an academic background in the subject.\nI had an interesting conversation with a group of peers on this topic recently. One person was a skilled freelance engineer who dropped out of college nearly two decades ago to enter the industry. Another was a junior developer with a master's degree in computer science who had previously taught at a university. I fell somewhere in between: I paid for higher education but pursued biology and got into tech 3 months after completing a rigorous bootcamp.\nWe all ended up succeeding in tech, but one question kept popping up - does having a degree in computer science increase your chances of excelling tech? Does any degree matter at all?\nThe seasoned engineer with 20 years of experience flatly stated that having a degree won't make any difference. In fact, his resume doesn't even show an \u0026quot;Education\u0026quot; section. The individual with a master's degree mostly agreed with him.\nThough it has its perks, going through college for a computer science degree won't magically make someone a good developer. You typically don't learn the most up-to-date tools in tech, but that's precisely what it takes to stay current with the industry. This means many graduates who failed to land internship positions during their time at college struggle to catch up to the cutting edge of the field.\nExperience \u0026gt; Education I too am convinced that a computer science degree is a waste of time for the most part. In fact, I've met computer science graduates who couldn't find work in their field because they didn't have the experience needed for success. I even met a woman who struggled to land her first position in tech for a solid 10 years after graduating with her computer science degree.\nClearly, it's not the end of the world if you decide to bypass a degree when working in tech. Several of the large Silicon Valley companies, such as Meta, Twitter, Apple, and Google are more likely to evaluate applicants primarily based on their capability rather than their educational background.\nBut keep in mind that many employers still have an older mentality that a degree is fundamental. Even in this case there are tactics one can use to gain employment with these kinds of firms, such as entering through the back door as a consultant.\nDon't get me wrong, I will say military or large corporate jobs may be more difficult to obtain without holding some type of qualification -- even if it is completely unrelated to the position at hand -- as having that piece of paper tends to come with certain social advantages.\nFor instance, someone with an associate's degree in computer science won't be as appealing to many companies as someone who has earned a bachelor's degree in any subject. I was able to witness this for myself when I was participating in my bootcamp program.\nWe can see that the degree itself — no matter the subject— is helpful, but simply networking or undergoing reputable programs can help you bypass the troubles you may face if you can't afford to go the higher education route.\nYour Network is also Your Net Worth I pressure those new to the tech world to build relationships and foster enthusiasm. Your contacts are truly your greatest asset, as they can offer assistance when the job market becomes unsteady, and you find yourself in need of a position. I still have peers who contact me about potential openings at startups.\nMoreover, having friends within the industry gives you an insight into what's going on—something that could be useful in deciding which technologies to pursue learning next.\nSo, it all comes down to this: don't unintentionally sever ties. Avoid falling victim to the fleeting connections that come with every new job or title. In fact, you should actively attend tech events to further immerse yourself in the industry so that you're always prepared in a volatile economy. I'm not talking about occasionally sharing posts on LinkedIn or taking up space in a career-focused group, but rather, educating yourself and providing value to a community and people's lives so that real connections are formed. That's how you build bridges that will last through any economic downturn.\nIf you're seeking a supportive environment to develop your knowledge, relax, and meet other techies, then join our TechDebtCrew on discord.

I've gotten into gardening, playing the piano, learning new languages, and digging deeper into philosophy.\nBut in some way, it feels as if I've opened up a can of worms that catapults me in a world where I just wish my brain could process things a little better -- store information a bit more efficiently, be just a tad bit smarter (scratch that, an extra 100 IQ points smarter).\nAI has highlighted my shortcomings in a way that goes beyond just feeling uncomfortable, it makes me wonder just how prepared we are for the inevitable future where satisfactory work is simply unacceptable, where we all must be able to produce extraordinary works in order to compete with the rapidly shifting world around us.\nNot only do you have to be a skilled developer, competent at algorithmic problems and completing tasks, but you also must possess a depth of knowledge that encompasses the entire breadth of your field and potentially beyond. You need to be acutely aware of your shortcomings and the limitations of your team's solutions. It's a demanding job, with no room for complacency.\nA true developer is simply a professional querier and without AI, people had the liberty of having a surface level understanding of the topic at hand, yet in a world where perfection is becoming more achievable than ever, you'll be expected to take in an immense amount of data and ask questions that can make your head feel like it's about to burst.\nI'm a person who often suffers from deep anxiety, and it makes it hard for me to just \u0026quot;turn off\u0026quot; my worries. I'll be stuck for an entire Sunday afternoon trying to figure out where I need to be in five years so that I don't get replaced by the rapid advances of technology.\nThis industry has never been one that allows you to stay in your comfort zone for too long, but AI is making it necessary to constantly update and hone your skillset more than ever before.\nAI tools such as ChatGPT might not replace our programming jobs tomorrow, in the next few months, or in the next couple years; but it certainly is possible in the next 5 to 10 years.\nSo, what happens when machines outperform us in tasks?

So, let's dive in and explore!\nInstallations: So personally, I prefer to customize my html components on my own personal server, so everyone isn't looking at each change I make on the web.I use Python SimpleHTTPServer for reasons that the name would suggest. SimpleHTTPServer is a basic web server module included in Python's standard library. It is primarily designed for serving static files over HTTP. It provides a simple way to create a basic web server for development or quick file sharing purposes.\nSo, to begin... 1. Install a Package Manager: For Windows, you can use Chocolatey as a package manager. To install Chocolatey, open an elevated Command Prompt (run as administrator) and execute the following command:\n@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \u0026quot;iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; SET \u0026quot;PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\chocolatey\\bin\u0026quot;\nFor other platforms like macOS or Linux, you can use the respective package manager such as Homebrew for macOS or apt for Ubuntu.\n2. Install Python: For Chocolatey (Windows): Open an elevated Command Prompt and run the following command to install Python:\nchoco install python\nFor Homebrew (macOS): Open Terminal and run the following command:\nbrew install python\nFor apt (Ubuntu or Debian-based Linux): Open Terminal and run the following command:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install python3\n3. Install pip (Python package manager): On most systems, pip comes pre-installed with Python. To verify if pip is installed, open a\nCommand Prompt or Terminal and run:\npip --version\nIf pip is not installed or you need to upgrade it, run the following command:\npy -m ensurepip --upgrade\n4. Python SimpleHTTPServer (Python 3): Python SimpleHTTPServer is included in Python 2+'s standard library.\nSo, if you have Python 3 installed, you already have SimpleHTTPServer...\nTo start the SimpleHTTPServer, navigate to the directory where you want to serve files using Command Prompt or Terminal, and run:\npython -m http.server\nThe server will start and serve files from the current directory on port 8000. You can access it in your web browser using http://localhost:8000.\nAlternatively... I highly recommend you get started with running applications on your own server and having these tools installed on your device (it’s an impressive addition to your resume after all!) but if you want to start somewhere else, CodePen is a great option. CodePen is an online code editor and social development platform designed for web developers. It provides a user-friendly platform where developers can write, test, and demonstrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets or full web projects.\nIf you are a front-end developer, you should definitely have a CodePen account so that you can easily network and show off your skills. Here’s a tiny snippet of the blogger codebase I use for my homepage.\nSee the Pen Untitled by Michelle (@a-m-long) on CodePen.\nI choose not to pay to keep my code private on CodePen, which is why I save my work via the local server discussed above. However, CodePen is still a fantastic way to start out flying if you are brand new to coding and just want to see what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all about.\nIt’s also a great space to look for some spark of inspiration. The CodePen community includes many talented front-end developers who can help make sure that your coding practices and styling are modern and fresh.\nTo the Basics Let's create a basic div component, we'll go with the classic: \u0026quot;Hello, World\u0026quot; heading.\nIn case you care to know, the phrase \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; has a long-standing tradition in the world of programming and is often used as the first program or introductory example when learning a new programming language. The origins of using \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; can be traced back to the seminal book \u0026quot;The C Programming Language\u0026quot; by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, published in 1978.\nIn the book, the authors included a simple introductory program in the C programming language that printed the text \u0026quot;hello, world\u0026quot; to the console. This example was used to illustrate the basic structure of a C program and demonstrate how to output text to the screen.\nSince then, \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; has become a standard and popular convention in programming tutorials, textbooks, and beginner programming exercises across various languages. It serves as a simple starting point to introduce the syntax, structure, and basic functionality of a programming language.\nFormat the HTML Components: All additional tags should be held within this container div to ensure optimal responsiveness.\n\u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026quot;h1\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Hello, World\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; I'm just typing random stuff here...\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\nLet's style this with CSS: body {\nbackground-color: lightblue;\n}\nh1 {\ncolor: red;\n}\nNow let's add some JavaScript logic: document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {\nvar h1 = document.getElementById('h1')\nif (h1) {\nh1.addEventListener('click', function () {\nalert('You\\'re clicking')\n});\n}\n})\nSo, if you were to paste this code in CodePen, you should see something like this:\nSee the Pen Hello, World by Michelle (@a-m-long) on CodePen.\nThe code anticipates the DOM loading, identifies the element with the ID \u0026quot;h1\u0026quot;, and adds a click event listener. Upon clicking the element, an alert box appears presenting the message \u0026quot;You're clicking\u0026quot;.\nThis code is relatively straightforward, but it will ignite your journey in comprehending how an html page can be manipulated. Feel free to dig into W3 Schools and get acquainted with various html tags (HTML Reference at w3schools.com).\nSo, How Responsive Is Your Page? Now, you may be wondering why I would shy away from using pixels when building HTML components. It's totally okay to use pixels for sizing, but if you size the component based on its parent's percentage, you're less apt to have an issue with responsiveness.\nIn HTML and CSS there are two primary units of measurement to choose from when defining sizes and dimensions--percentage (e.g., 50%) or pixels (px). The ideal choice between either really depends on the exact purpose of the element and the desired outcome.\nHere are some reasons why percentages might be preferred over pixels in certain scenarios:\n1. Responsive Design: Percentages are commonly used in responsive web design to create fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. By using percentages for widths, heights, and margins, elements can dynamically adjust their size relative to the parent container or viewport, resulting in a more responsive and flexible design.\n2. Relative Sizing: Percentages allow for relative sizing, which means elements can scale proportionally based on their parent container or surrounding elements. This is useful when you want the size of an element to be relative to its context, allowing for more consistent and adaptable designs across different screen resolutions.\n3. Fluid Grid Systems: Percentages are integral to creating fluid grid systems, where the layout is based on proportional divisions. This approach allows for the creation of grid-based designs that automatically adjust to different screen sizes, providing a consistent and harmonious layout.\n4. Accessibility: Using percentages can improve accessibility by allowing users to adjust the text size or zoom level in their web browsers without breaking the layout. Elements that are sized in percentages will scale accordingly, ensuring that the content remains readable and usable at different zoom levels.\n5. Device Independence: By utilizing percentages, designs become less dependent on specific pixel values, making them more adaptable to different devices with varying pixel densities. This helps ensure that the design remains visually consistent and readable across different devices and screen resolutions.\nThe choice between using percentage or pixels depends on the design requirements, responsiveness goals, and the specific needs of the elements being styled. A combination of both units may be used in different parts of a web page to achieve the desired layout and responsiveness, but I rarely find the use of pixels to be necessary and if you're not careful, you'll end up with an application that looks beautiful on your laptop and horribly distorted on your mobile phone.\nA few concepts to review: 1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML forms the backbone of any web page. It provides the structure and defines the content within the page. Here are the key concepts to grasp:\nStructure and Syntax: Understand the basic structure of an HTML document, including the doctype declaration, ``, ``, and `` tags. Learn how to create elements and use tags to define headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.\nAttributes and Styling: Explore how to add attributes to HTML elements, such as the `class` and `id` attributes for styling and manipulation. Familiarize yourself with HTML entities for displaying special characters.\nForms and Input: Discover how to create forms and collect user input using various input types like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus.\nSemantic HTML: Learn about semantic elements like ``, ``, ``, ``, and ``, which provide meaningful structure to your web page and enhance accessibility.\n2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS brings life to your web page by styling and formatting HTML elements. Here's what you need to know:\nSelectors and Declarations: Understand how CSS selectors target specific HTML elements and how declarations define the styles. Learn about various selector types, including element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors.\nBox Model and Layout: Grasp the concept of the box model, which defines the spacing and dimensions of elements. Explore how to control layout using properties like `margin`, `padding`, `display`, and `position`.\nTypography and Colors: Learn how to customize fonts, sizes, and styles using CSS properties like `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `color`. Discover ways to incorporate colors through hexadecimal codes, named colors, or RGB values.\nCSS Flexbox and Grid: Dive into modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, which provide powerful tools for creating responsive and dynamic layouts.\n3. JavaScript: JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that adds interactivity and functionality to web pages. Here's an overview:\nVariables and Data Types: Get familiar with declaring variables, assigning values, and understanding different data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.\nFunctions and Control Flow: Learn how to define and call functions to execute reusable blocks of code. Explore control flow statements like `if` and `else` for conditional logic and loops like `for` and `while` for repetitive tasks.\nDOM Manipulation: Discover how JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically manipulate web page elements, such as updating text, changing styles, handling events, and creating interactive features.\nExternal Scripts and Libraries: Explore how to include external JavaScript files and leverage popular libraries like jQuery for simplified DOM manipulation or other frameworks for advanced web development.\nBy taking the plunge into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you’ve taken an empowering step towards mastering Web Development. Just remember, practice really does make perfect! So keep tinkering, creating projects, and delving into external resources to further your skills. Embrace this journey with passion and soon you’ll be crafting stunning webpages like a pro.\nHappy coding!\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/06/beginners-guide-html-css-and-javascript.html","section":"post","tags":["JavaScript","Programming","CSS","Front-end Development","HTML","Programming Tutorial"],"title":"Beginner's Guide: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Tutorial for Building Web Pages"},{"body":"","link":"//localhost:1313/tags/HTML/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"HTML"},{"body":"\rCompeting with AI - What Steps to Take as Artificial Intelligence Advances\rNo one needs to be reminded that artificial intelligence (AI) is growing increasingly powerful and intimidating. Companies such as Wendy's already want to use AI in place of humans to carry out certain tasks.\nEventually, this could lead to a massive recession in white-collar jobs, leaving many people asking how they can compete with something that never sleeps, never takes a break or requests a raise, and works around the clock. The answer is simply: don't compete. Instead, stay informed of the latest news on AI advancements.\nAt present, developers are still necessary to make sure automated tools like ChatGPT-4 function properly; however, this demand might lessen when the technology develops further in the next five to ten years.\nSo, here's what I anticipate will happen with regards to AI: Front-end developers will start shifting their focus from development to more design focused. Developing creative designs for webpages requires some effort. Anyone can make a website, but to truly capture the attention of the target audience and stand out from the competition, it needs to be interactive and unique.\nAdvancements in AI are making designing custom websites easier than ever before, and soon everyone will need to become proficient prompt engineers in order to complete tasks efficiently. Consequently, programming skills alone won't cut it anymore, so many are signing up for design school courses such as Canva to learn how to design websites, presentations, and more.\nA great way to kick off your search is by exploring some of the popular websites such as Awwwards, Designer News, and Designspiration.\nBack-end developers will shoulder more responsibilities As a former Java developer, it has become obvious that back-end developers are being asked to do more with less. Staying up-to-date with new languages and technologies is now essential for success in the field, and often I am contacted by employers looking for DevOps or SRE professionals due to my ability to quickly learn and apply new skillsets. This trend appears to be the way of the future for any back-end development position.\nIn addition to requiring a broader understanding of features and services, developers will also be held accountable for the business aspects of their work. They will no longer remain in the background; instead, they will need to make decisions regarding the design, flow, and framework of development and stand out more.\nI have witnessed several employers prioritize communication skills and a stage presence in their developers, emphasizing the need for them to be able to confidently share ideas with people outside of development. Consequently, I think it is likely that developers will move from introverted tendencies to having an affable and engaging nature.\nScrum Masters Will Be Expected to Utilize AI tools to improve team organization. It is plain to see that Scrum Masters have a lot to gain from the use of Artificial Intelligence. This technology can make ticketing far easier and assist in task management, including bug tracking, backlog grooming, and sprint planning. However, in the next 5-10 years it is likely that this position will become less relevant due to automation.\nIn light of this, Scrum Masters must look towards roles encompassing higher-level activities such as mentoring team members and encouraging creativity within their sprints. Having a strong programming/technical background will be more important to these individuals than ever before.\nIn conclusion, AI is really capable of weeding out the individuals who don't perform well in their jobs. Those who dedicate themselves to honing their skills and familiarizing themselves with the industry will still do great, but those who have a superficial understanding and view technology simply as a source of income will find it increasingly hard to succeed when their skills can be easily replaced by artificial intelligence.\nAI encourages us all to tap into our problem-solving capacity - questioning if current practices are best suited for your needs and evaluating new technologies that could help improve your business.\nWe will need to use both critical and creative thinking to come up with solutions while letting AI detect any flaws in these plans and handle technical duties on our behalf.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/05/competing-with-ai-what-steps-to-take-as.html","section":"post","tags":["AI","Programming","Career Development"],"title":"Competing with AI - What Steps to Take as Artificial Intelligence Advances"},{"body":"\rI had been considering tech blogging for almost a year, wanting to expand my knowledge of programming and help others learn from my experiences. A few months ago, I finally decided it was time to take the plunge and commit to actively blogging.\nThis keeps me accountable, and when I document what I learn, new questions arise that inspire me to research further.\nWorking in tech thrusts you into a wild world of challenges and how you respond to them determines whether you're an average or proficient programmer.\nCreating a blog is an incredible way to make your mark in the tech field and show off your expertise. This can be especially useful if you’re at the mid to junior dev level and need an edge to stand out from the crowd trying to break into the industry. It can also help bolster your network of important contacts.\nBy writing blogs consistently, you can demonstrate your ability to stay up-to-date with new technologies and trends in the field. You may even have a chance to weigh in on broader conversations about coding practices and potentially locate problems in existing codesets.\nMoreover, developing blog posts provides an avenue for personal growth as it necessitates critically analyzing technologies in relation to their specific applications. In other words, it encourages deeper thinking and strengthens problem-solving skills.\nFinally, tech blogging cultivates open dialogue between developers and non-programmers which allows us to consider social implications when looking at development approaches.\nAltogether, tech blogging is an excellent way to advance your career in the technology field and gain valuable experience. It is also a platform for expressing yourself creatively and conversing openly with other professionals.\nWith all that being said, one might wonder where they might begin their journey as a tech blogger. For the time being, I prefer to keep things simple, so I use Blogger. Blogger is a popular option that many beginners opt for because it is free, user-friendly and offers helpful tutorials. It also allows for custom domain names, making it easier for readers to find you online. Blogger also has basic SEO capabilities natively build in and allows you to control the layout of your blog posts with HTML or CSS code. The downside is that users are limited in terms of customization options available.\nBut there are many other blogging platforms and static site generators that are competitors of Blogger. Here are a few examples:\n1. WordPress: WordPress is another popular choice for tech bloggers. It's an open-source content management system (CMS) which makes it highly customizable and can be integrated with other platforms such as Google Analytics. WordPress does require more technical knowledge than Blogger though so might not be suitable for those just starting out.\n2. Ghost: Ghost is a great option if you're looking for simplicity over complexity when creating your blog posts as it has a minimalist design but still allows you to add tags, categories and create newsletters easily. However, Ghost is not open source like WordPress so there are fewer customization options and plugins available compared to WordPress.\nJekyll: I'm honestly torn between using Hugo and Jekyll in the future. Jekyll is an excellent static site generator mainly used by developers who want more control over their website’s content without having to worry about coding from scratch each time they need something updated or changed. It's also an open-source platform that YOU can actively contribute to, so it's definitely worth looking into to build your portfolio and network with other devs. 4. Gatsby: Gatsby is another great option for tech bloggers who are looking for performance along with modern web technologies like React JSX and GraphQL integration integrated into their blogs or websites. Gatsby comes with a large plugin ecosystem allowing users the ability to customize most elements of their websites down the line in order to suit their needs better while keeping good performance throughout the project lifetime. Like Jekyll, Gatsby is also open source, so you can contribute to Gatsby's code base and community.\n5. Medium: Medium is a popular online publishing platform that allows you to write and publish articles on a range of topics. It offers a simple and intuitive interface, as well as features like tags, categories, and a built-in audience. I have a few coworkers who post on Medium. This option won't provide you with your own site, but you can build visibility to yourself or your own personal website.\n6.Hugo: Hugo is also an excellent choice for developers who want to exercise more dominance over their website. It's a platform that is cherished for its agility, security, adaptability, and customization capabilities. Besides, since it's also an open source platform, it's a perfect way for developers to contribute to its development on GitHub. As a Go developer, I find Hugo to be the most attractive of the open source options because it's written in Go.\nWhen beginning to think about tech blogging, you have many different platforms and tools at your disposal. Before making a decision on which one to use, it’s important to understand the different features of each platform.\nI hope this advice will help you out.

It enables developers to use a single configuration language to describe and provision resources across multiple cloud providers -- a time-saving measure that makes it easier to support multiple regions and cloud environments from a single platform.\nBut while Terraform provides a robust solution for streamlining the process of setting up and managing cloud resources, testing components of the setup is often neglected. Without the proper testing tools, Terraform users often risk leaving services behind in the environments and spending valuable time waiting for pipelines to complete builds.\nThis is why Localstack proves to be so invaluable. It's a highly-treasured open-source utility that grants users the power to run cloud services locally, making it ideal for both testing and development. This way, developers won't need to make pipelines or wait for builds to finish-- they can just emulate cloud programs on their computer with its APIs, CLI, and UI dashboard.\nLocalstack also helps to reduce costs associated with cloud infrastructure. By running tests locally before deploying their code, developers can realize cost savings by avoiding the need for expensive remote resources.\nIn addition to cost savings, Localstack helps Terraform users test their configurations more efficiently without having to deploy them in the actual cloud environment first. By utilizing a local development environment, Terraform users can quickly modify their configurations and adjust them accordingly. This decreases the time spent waiting on builds and potentially reduces time-to-production by days or even weeks.\nBy taking advantage of all that Localstack has to offer -- including its APIs, CLI, UI dashboard, and built-in support for multiple cloud providers -- Terraform users can easily create repeatable processes that test their configurations against different scenarios and develop reliable systems at scale.\nRequired Installations: docker, localstack, pip, tflocal, awscli\nFirst, you have to create a Terraform module that creates an AWS S3 bucket with the following code:\n1 2provider \u0026#34;aws\u0026#34; { 3 region = \u0026#34;us-east-1\u0026#34; 4 access_key = \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; 5 secret_key = \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; 6 endpoint = \u0026#34;http://localhost:4566\u0026#34; 7 s3_force_path_style = true 8} 9 10resource \u0026#34;aws_s3_bucket\u0026#34; \u0026#34;example_bucket\u0026#34; { 11 bucket = var.bucket_name 12} 2. Create a `variables.tf` file in the same directory as `main.tf`, with the following content:\n1 2variable \u0026#34;bucket_name\u0026#34; { 3 description = \u0026#34;Name of the S3 bucket\u0026#34; 4 type = string 5 default = \u0026#34;my-test-bucket\u0026#34; 6} 7 8variable \u0026#34;aws_access_key\u0026#34; { 9 description = \u0026#34;AWS access key\u0026#34; 10 type = string 11} 12 13variable \u0026#34;aws_secret_key\u0026#34; { 14 description = \u0026#34;AWS secret key\u0026#34; 15 type = string 16} 3. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the same directory as `main.tf`, with the following content:\n1 2 3bucket_name = \u0026#34;my-test-bucket\u0026#34; 4aws_access_key = \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; 5aws_secret_key = \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; 4. Start LocalStack on your machine by running the following command:\n1 2 3localstack start -d 5. In a separate terminal window, navigate to the directory where your Terraform module is located and run the following commands:\n1 2 3export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test 4export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test 5terraform init 6terraform apply 6. After Terraform completes the apply, you should see a new S3 bucket created in LocalStack with the name `my-test-bucket`.\nThat's it! You have just tested an AWS module using Terraform with LocalStack and variables.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/05/unlock-power-of-localstack-testing.html","section":"post","tags":["Programming","tutorial","Programming Tutorial","terraform"],"title":"Unlock the Power of Localstack: Testing Terraform Cloud Resources on Your Local Machine"},{"body":"\rWhen I was just starting out in programming, I wanted to work on projects that were more stimulating. My approach to learning was to craft projects that made technology relevant and exciting for me. Reading books and taking courses will only get you so far; the rest is all self-driven. This is how bots and data scraping caught my attention. Programming became more than a job - it became an art form. If you can make a working bot, then you probably have the skills necessary for most tech jobs as a programmer.\nIn that spirit, I'm going to teach you the basics of programming a bot to run on your local machine. This is the first article in my bot series. Generally speaking, we'll be using selenium for this project.\nA caveat: please be mindful when using selenium. This is purely for educational purposes. Plenty of websites and networks enforce strict policies to discourage data scraping, which they may consider akin to hacking even if you intend no harm such as automating likes and follows.\nSelenium is a powerful and popular open-source automation tool that can be used to automate web browsers. It comes with a suite of tools designed to make web testing, scraping, and any other routine tasks much easier.\nThis amazing tool allows you to interact with browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox using programming languages like Python, Java, C#, and Go. With Selenium, you can write scripts that allow you to click on buttons and links, fill out forms, and navigate between pages – all without lifting a finger!\nThe way Selenium works is by interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) of any given web page. The DOM is made up of HTML elements that act as a hierarchical structure. By providing a range of APIs for simulating user actions (clicking links and buttons) and extracting information from the page (text and data), Selenium easily automates those tedious tasks.\nSo, here's a demonstration of how you can begin building a Selenium bot with Golang. Also, feel free to pull down the code base here.\nLet's start off with creating a new directory. I'm naming mine Bubble because I thought it would be a cute name for a bot. And I guess I put a little thought into it because Bubble's ultimate purpose is to keep me in my own personal bubble, so I don't have to manually search though the web to get certain information.\nSo, we can create a file named bubble.go (you can really name it whatever) and add the main function like this.```\npackage main\nfunc main() {\n}\n1 2 3 4To generate the module file for your dependencies, type go mod init bubble.go and then execute go mod tidy. The content of the module file will depend on the version of Go being used, but it should look something like this: module bubble.go\ngo 1.17\n1 2 3 4 5 6Our bot will need a webdriver to navigate through the browser in the same way a human would. 7 8 9 10To begin, you\u0026#39;ll have to get the chromedriver (or any other driver you prefer) and put it into your directory. You can download the correct version that corresponds to your Chrome browser version and operating system. ([click here for the link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)) 11 12 13 14Once downloaded, you can extract the zip into your project directory. 15 16 17 18In order to implement the webdriver, we will need to install the selenium package. We can do so by executing the following commands: go get -u github.com/tebeka/selenium go get -u github.com/tebeka/selenium/chrome\n1 2 3 4We can then import the package in our program as follows: import ( \u0026quot;github.com/tebeka/selenium\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/tebeka/selenium/chrome\u0026quot; )\n1 2 3 4You\u0026#39;ll see the dependencies added to the go.mod file, as well as to the larger go.sum file. If you read my article related to [Software Composition Analysis (SCA)](https://techdebtgyal.blogspot.com/2023/03/diving-into-dependency-forest-with.html), you can gain a better understanding of go dependencies and how you can manipulate them for security reasons. 5 6 7 8With the package imported, we can now set up the webdriver by creating a Selenium WebDriver using chrome. The code to do this is as follows: func main() {\n//create a webdriver instance driver, err := selenium.NewChromeDriverService(\u0026quot;./chromedriver\u0026quot;,4444) if err != nil { panic(err) } defer driver.Stop()\n//add custom driver capabilities as a chrome driver caps := selenium.Capabilities{} caps.AddChrome(chrome.Capabilities{Args: []string{ \u0026quot;window-size=1920x1080\u0026quot;, }})\n//create a new remote client with configured capabilities wd, err := selenium.NewRemote(caps, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) if err != nil { panic(err) }\n//tells the driver to go to desired webpage wd.Get(\u0026quot;[WHATEVERWEBSITEYOUCHOOSE]\u0026quot;)\n}\n1 2We start off by initializing the chrome driver, which we then halt the execution of. Afterwards, we customize the driver by setting the window size. We then create a new client with our pre-configured capacity and url prefix to finally direct it to the website. 3 4 5 6Provided you downloaded the correct version of your driver, a brief pop up will appear displaying your bot accessing the site you directed it to. If nothing appears on the screen, a message might display in the terminal regarding a problem between your driver and the version of the browser you\u0026#39;re using. 7 8 9 10So now we\u0026#39;re at the fun part. Let\u0026#39;s say you have to go through a login process. So, without logging in, manually navigate to the main page of the site you\u0026#39;re on. Right click on the login button and then right click again on the button tag to copy the xpath which is essentially the exact location of the html component of interest. 11 12 13 14I wouldn\u0026#39;t advise copying the full xpath. This is because the absolute xpath can become invalidated due to HTML modifications after a few days and thus is not always dependable. 15 16 17 18Let\u0026#39;s take a look at this login process. I gave it a minute to load the page so the bot could locate the DOM elements. Initially, the bot looks for the login button. After it identifies the button, it finds the email and password fields. Then, I use the SendKeys() method to enter the user credentials into the form. Lastly, I search for the sign-in popup\u0026#39;s login button and use the Click() method to complete the action. 19 20**Note: I must add a warning that the developers are continually updating the user interface, which means that the same xpath you use today might not work tomorrow or even in an hour.** func login(wd selenium.WebDriver) error { wd.SetImplicitWaitTimeout(60000000000 * time.Nanosecond)\nloginBtn, err := wd.FindElement(selenium.ByXPATH, \u0026quot;//location of login btn\u0026quot;)\rif err != nil {\rreturn err\r}\rif err = loginBtn.Click(); err != nil {\rreturn err\r}\remail, err := wd.FindElement(selenium.ByXPATH, \u0026quot;//*[@id=\\\u0026quot;email\\\u0026quot;]\u0026quot;)\rif err != nil {\rreturn err\r}\rpassword, err := wd.FindElement(selenium.ByXPATH, \u0026quot;//*[@id=\\\u0026quot;password\\\u0026quot;]\u0026quot;)\rif err != nil {\rreturn err\r}\rif err = email.SendKeys(\u0026quot;your email address\u0026quot;); err != nil {\rreturn err\r}\rif err = password.SendKeys(\u0026quot;your password\u0026quot;); err != nil {\rreturn err\r}\rloginBtn, err = wd.FindElement(selenium.ByXPATH, \u0026quot;//this is the second login btn\u0026quot;)\rif err = loginBtn.Click(); err != nil {\rreturn err\r}\rfmt.Println(\u0026quot;We're logged in!!!\u0026quot;)\rreturn nil\r}\n1 2 3 4If you understand this, constructing a bot is pretty simple. I use the same process repeatedly to browse through any site. You can see below that I created this search method to search for an element via the search bar. Again, I pause for a minute to let the page finish loading and then find the necessary elements to execute a search. The \u0026#34;\\\\n\u0026#34; is for the bot to essentially press \u0026#34;enter\u0026#34; on the search bar. func search(wd selenium.WebDriver) error { wd.SetImplicitWaitTimeout(60000000000)\nsearchBar, err := wd.FindElement(selenium.ByXPATH, \u0026quot;//location of search box\u0026quot;)\rif err != nil {\rreturn err\r}\rsearchBar.SendKeys(\u0026quot;stuff\\n\u0026quot;)\rfmt.Printf(\u0026quot;We were able to search\u0026quot;)\rreturn err\r}\n1 2 3 4In order for the bot to locate the relevant elements, I crafted a scrollForElement() function that incorporates a script that scrolls down the DOM until the element is visible. When the element is found, the bot clicks the element and returns nil. func scrollForElement(wd selenium.WebDriver, parentXpath string, xpath string) error { var err error script := fmt.Sprintf(` var elem = document.evaluate(\u0026quot;%s\u0026quot;, parent, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue; var parent = document.evaluate(\u0026quot;%s\u0026quot;, document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue;\nif (elem) {\relem.click();\rreturn true;\r} else {\rparent.scrollTop = parent.scrollHeight;\rreturn false;\r}\r`, parentXpath, xpath)\rfound := false\rfor !found {\rif _, err := wd.ExecuteScript(script, nil); err != nil {\rreturn fmt.Errorf(\u0026quot;failed to execute script: %w\u0026quot;, err)\r}\relem, err := wd.FindElement(selenium.ByXPATH, xpath)\rif elem != nil {\rfound = true\r}\rif err != nil {\rreturn errors.New(\u0026quot;Failed to find element\u0026quot;)\r}\r}\rreturn err\r}\n1 2 3 4We employ this technique in two of our functions: getPosts() and savePost(). Both rely on elements that may not be visible when a page is initially loaded, thus requiring the user to scroll down to uncover them. 5 6 7 8This savePost() function utilizes the scrollForElement() method to find the element and save it before going to the previous page. func savePost(wd selenium.WebDriver, err error) error { saveButton := \u0026quot;//*save button location\u0026quot;\nerr = scrollForElement(wd, saveButton, \u0026quot;//page\u0026quot;)\rif err != nil {\rfmt.Println(err.Error())\rreturn err\r}\rwd.Back()\rfmt.Println(\u0026quot;Saved the element going to previous page\u0026quot;)\rreturn nil // no error\r}\n1 2 3 4The getPosts() function takes the final step of selecting 10 elements to save. To make this faster, we utilize threading via creating a go func. Threading is helpful because it makes it possible for us to implement concurrent processing. I set up a for loop that calls both the save() and findElement() functions to store 10 posts. func getPosts(wd selenium.WebDriver) error { var wg sync.WaitGroup div := 1 var err error\nfor i := 1; i \u0026lt; 10; i++ {\rwg.Add(1)\rgo func(i int) {\rdefer wg.Done()\rxpath := fmt.Sprintf(\u0026quot;//post location\u0026quot;, div)\r_, err := wd.FindElement(selenium.ByXPATH, xpath)\rfor err != nil {\rdiv++\rxpath := fmt.Sprintf(\u0026quot;//xpath with an increased div count in case there is an ad\u0026quot;, div)\rerr = scrollForElement(wd, xpath, \u0026quot;//page\u0026quot;)\rif err != nil {\rreturn\r}\rerr = savePost(wd, err)\rif err != nil {\rreturn\r}\rfmt.Printf(\u0026quot;\\nWe have successfully saved a post %d\u0026quot;, i)\rdiv++\r}else{\rpost, err := wd.FindElement(selenium.ByXPATH, fmt.Sprintf(\u0026quot;//post\u0026quot;, div)\rpost.Click()\rerr = savePost(wd, err)\rif err != nil {\rreturn\r} else {\rfmt.Printf(\u0026quot;\\nWe have successfully saved a post %d\u0026quot;, i)\rdiv++\r}\r}\r}(i)\r}\rwg.Wait()\rfmt.Println(\u0026quot;\\nI think this works\u0026quot;)\rreturn err\r}\n1 2 3``` 4 5Let\u0026#39;s take a break right here. We achieved our goal of installing the driver, logging in to a website, and I showed you a simple example of how to save a random post on a page. Here\u0026#39;s how I pieced everything together in the main function: 6 7``` 8 9import ( 10 \u0026#34;errors\u0026#34; 11 \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; 12 \u0026#34;sync\u0026#34; 13 \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; 14 15 \u0026#34;github.com/tebeka/selenium\u0026#34; 16 \u0026#34;github.com/tebeka/selenium/chrome\u0026#34; 17) 18 19func main() { 20 21 driver, err := selenium.NewChromeDriverService(\u0026#34;./chromedriver\u0026#34;, 4444) 22 if err != nil { 23 panic(err) 24 } 25 defer driver.Stop() 26 27 caps := selenium.Capabilities{} 28 caps.AddChrome(chrome.Capabilities{Args: []string{ 29 \u0026#34;window-size=1920x1080\u0026#34;, 30 }}) 31 32 wd, err := selenium.NewRemote(caps, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) 33 if err != nil { 34 panic(err) 35 } 36 wd.DeleteAllCookies() 37 38 if err := wd.Get(\u0026#34;[Website]\u0026#34;); err != nil { 39 fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Could not log into site: %s\u0026#34;, err) 40 } 41 42 if err = login(wd); err != nil { 43 fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Could not log into site: %s\u0026#34;, err) 44 } 45 46 if err = search(wd); err != nil { 47 fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Unable to submit search: %s\u0026#34;, err) 48 } 49 50 if err = getPosts(wd); err != nil { 51 fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Failed to get Posts: %s\u0026#34;, err) 52 } 53 54} 1Sure, there are more features we could add, but that\u0026#39;ll be your job to explore.

The hard worker. The one who always has ambition focused on providing for their family. I had the do-it-all attitude-- valuing independence and dedication to the point where I knew I could do anything if I put my heart into it. And this outlook resulted in great achievements and successes as well as an unbelievable amount of pressure.\nI was the teammate unwilling to draw attention to myself, even if I handled the majority of the job. I did this because I thought being a good team member was more important than highlighting my accomplishments. It reached the point where people would subtly come to me for help without mentioning my involvement during meetings.\nIt reached the point where I would be given tasks that some senior developers couldn't do, and I finished each task swiftly, usually before any other teammates realized how complicated they were.\nSo, I certainly minimized my role at my own cost-- devoting effort to aid others over showcasing the fact that I worked diligently on tasks that people with much more experience couldn't accomplish within the same timeframe.\nSure, I got compliments during the retrospectives and people thanked me for my help so they wouldn't have to suffer as much as I did. But did it come with rewards like bonuses or higher raises than anyone else? Of course not!\nEach sprint simply become worse than the last. Despite helping out others, I was made the designated person to explore uncharted fields of technology, such as improving our architecture or migrating to a language that none of us had any knowledge of.\nAs a consequence, I brought upon myself the belief that \u0026quot;If I can just get through this ticket, everything will be okay\u0026quot;. But things never improved; the void of stress only deepened.\nUnfortunately, I had become a target of one of the senior developers who was well-known for his hard-to-work-with attitude. Whenever I had to collaborate with him, I was forced to be constantly vigilant. It felt like I had been cast into hell and it was all my own doing.\nI bring up an important issue, one that female tech workers face regularly. Sadly, the more you climb corporate ladders, the worse it gets. I've had project managers break down on the phone with me as they describe being emotionally abused by directors who lack empathy and accountability.\nUnfortunately, for a woman to survive in this kind of setting the only viable solution is to be as aggressive as her male counterparts. This leads many women to act less like friends and more like adversaries towards each other in the workplace environment.\nFor me, tech is a means to an end. I wear my heart on my sleeve and corporate simply isn't for me. I've worked in fintech for nearly 4 years, and I use that money to fund my investments and become more active within my community.\nI often remind myself that I'm being paid for a particular job and no more. That way, it won't be wrong for me to maintain a consistent work level, allocate some time away from work, or simply spend quality time with family members on the weekends.\nSo, if you're anything like me, I want to remind you that it's okay to take a step back and smell the roses. After all, the stress really isn't worth your well-being.\nSide Note: The book 'How Women Rise' is beneficial not just for women, but anyone looking to better their career prospects, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds!

No one wanted to expound on it, so another person timidly suggested, \u0026quot;I guess it means the program has no side effects?\u0026quot; - disregarding that applications written in languages such as Pascal or Scala still generate some kind of result.\nIt became obvious that most people in the group didn't have an extensive knowledge of functional programming. A few participants in the group mumbled through a deficient description of functional programming while using the term within the definition, which simply produced further queries than answers.\nAll things considered, it was unmistakable that this could be an interesting topic to discuss.\nSo, what is functional programming? Scratching the surface, one might say it's a style of programming with the focus of utilizing pure functions to prevent side-effects in the application. Does this mean functional programming is language specific, or can a language typically used for OOP be utilized for functional programming? If so, what makes common functional programming languages optimal for functional programming?\nIf you can answer these questions, then you're in a better position than many who claim to be functional programming experts.\nLet's start off with the idea of \u0026quot;pure functions\u0026quot; - functions which have no side-effects and return the same output given the same input every time. This means that the function can be used multiple times without having to worry about unintended consequences.\nFunctional programming also features immutable data, meaning that once a value has been set, it cannot be changed (this helps to prevent bugs). Languages such as Haskell or Lisp are often used for functional programming since they naturally support these features.\nHowever, OOP languages such as Java or C# can still be utilized for functional programming with libraries and frameworks such as Functional Java or F#. These languages might not offer the same level of code optimization for purely functional applications but can still serve well in many cases.\nBut what does this really mean? Shouldn't our functions be tested and optimized to ensure that they don't produce undesirable results anyway? In what way does carefully written code in an OOP language produce side effects? This here is the huge gaping hole in the typical functional programming definition that left me feeling as if I knew nothing about functional programming.\nIn OOP languages, functions are often \u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot; as part of classes. This makes it difficult to test and debug them since other parts of the class may be interacting with them. In functional languages, functions are isolated from each other, making it easier to test their behavior independently. This also means that changes to one function won't necessarily cause problems in other parts of the system.\nWhen considering functional versus object-oriented programming, pros and cons exist for each style. Java or C# are examples of object-oriented languages that have the advantage of encapsulation, which allows specific code snippets to be separated from one another. This may make debugging more challenging, however it also helps create a securer program.\nOn the other hand, functional programming languages tend to be more optimized for writing purely functional applications, which means they can reduce the amount of code required to do certain tasks or make certain operations run faster. This makes them great for data-intensive tasks or applications where performance is key.\nOne downside of functional programming languages is that they require a somewhat steeper learning curve due to their complex syntax and lacking debugging tools. Since these types of languages aren't usually implemented in web development, there is an extreme lack of experienced developers who understand how to actively use them, creating a shortage for those coders who have knowledge on the subject. This might explain why many functional programmers find themselves struggling to define it.\nI tend to concur with the opinion of this article that functional programming is more of a personal preference rather than a superior way of coding. If you're the type of programmer who enjoys discovering the wizardry happening in the background when programming, then you might lean towards functional programming.\nStill, one might argue that if you're using 3rd party libraries, you're always going to be working with some magic, right?\nUltimately though, if you want to get into functional programming, its best to start out with one of the more established functional languages like Haskell or Scala. By doing so you can become comfortable with fundamental concepts like recursion before tackling a hybrid language.\nSide Note: I like to stay up-to-date with the latest tech trends for obvious reasons. But I've noticed that many fellow female professionals don't have the same access to resources from their jobs or in their personal lives, which got me thinking of how I could help out. My solution? A group specifically designed to discuss technical topics and open dialogue between women in the industry.

A Introductory Article to Help the Uninitiated Understand Functional Programming"},{"body":"\rI find it concerning when people join online forums and discuss how to get a tech job without needing to ever touch code or have a degree in computer science, IT, or any other related field.\nIt only serves to make it tougher for those people who don't possess the diploma, but are serious about gaining experience, to be taken seriously. Eventually, businesses will start sifting through resumes and only consider applicants with relevant degrees from the industry.\nTechnical know-how can be a tremendous aid to your career, and to the people around you. If you want to select the most capable candidates for positions on your team, or understand the technical details behind clients' requirements, having development experience is essential.\nWhile the actual coding might be left to tech leads and developers, with a technical background, you can bridge any divide between business goals and software solutions.\nThe challenge of working people who don’t necessarily have the technical know-how is particularly noticeable when dealing with scrum masters. A competent scrum master will ensure team meetings run on time, personnel are properly organized, and projects are completed in a timely manner.\nNever underestimate the importance of having clearly defined tickets. They are essential to ensuring successful completion of a sprint. A decent scrum master is so much more than a taskmaster: they are also adept at identifying and removing blockers, ensuring seamless communication between different teams, and effectively communicating the required tasks that need to be accomplished.\nA bad scrum master, on the other hand, will be a liability to their team, an additional burden that slows down progress. Poorly tracked business requirements, excessive meetings that eat into valuable coding time, and developers forced to take up the slack left by an inadequate scrum master are all indicators of this kind of sub-par performance.\nRemember: your team's success depends on your ability to lead them effectively. With that being said, here are 5 reasons why scrum masters should have a technical background.\n1. It gives you an edge when selecting team members — You will be able to better evaluate the technical skills of potential candidates and ensure that your team has the expertise it needs for optimal performance.\n2. You can understand requirements and technical solutions better — Having a technical background gives you a better understanding of the client's requirements, as well as the software solutions required to fulfill them.\n3. You can bridge any divide between business goals and software solutions — As a scrum master, you are responsible for ensuring that organizational objectives are met, but programming experience helps you better connect with developers and make sure their work aligns with the company’s desired outcomes.\n4. You're more adept at troubleshooting any issues — With development experience, you can spot issues in production applications quickly and begin to work on solutions right away, rather than having to wait for others to come up with ways around them.\n5. You can provide more effective guidance — Being able to speak the same language as your developers and tech leads allows you to offer meaningful advice regarding their projects and help them prioritize tasks more effectively. This makes everyone’s workload lighter while still reaching all goals in a timely manner.\nI'm a firm believer that people should have the chance to get into tech if they're willing to put in the effort. Just keep in mind that these jobs aren't as easy as some may think, especially without prior technical knowledge. You'll end up creating a lot of stress for yourself if you don't take this into consideration.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/04/attention-all-scrum-masters-heres-why.html","section":"post","tags":["Lifestyle"],"title":"Attention all Scrum Masters: Here's Why YOU Should Learn Programming!!! "},{"body":" At the beginning of my adulting journey, I had been searching for a way to make something of my life; a way to start a career and be able to travel the world at the same time. I've heard of people doing it – making money online as digital nomads.\nIt seemed like something I could do, something that I could learn and make money from, in my own time and from anywhere in the world.\nI had spent countless hours researching, scouring the internet for all the information I could find about digital nomadism in general--from social media marketing to programming.\nAt the time, it seemed to be more of an intangible dream that could put me in a financially strained position if I didn't know what I was doing.\nAnd so, I was determined to make it happen, and I felt like I was finally ready to take the plunge. Shortly after I graduated from college, I signed up for a programming bootcamp after struggling to land a lab corps research position that related to my biology degree.\nAs someone who had zero programming experience outside of reading a book about java programming days before my interview, the bootcamp was certainly intense, but I picked up enough coding knowledge to start working on my own projects and get a grasp of the industry.\nShortly after completing the program, I was contracted off to work for a fortune 500 company in the San Francisco Bay area where I would make barely enough to get by--renting a bedroom with a bathroom for $1500 a month.\nIt was a huge leap of faith, but I was determined to make the most of it and see what else the world had in store for me. The job ended up being the start of a journey that would take me all around the world, and I couldn't be more grateful.\nTo begin, I focus on the advantages of technology - travel, learning, growth, and opportunity that it can bring. These are opportunities not just for those who majored in computer science or IT related fields, but also for people with degrees in other disciplines.\nI have a friend who studied criminal justice and he can write code better than most developers I know. That's why my initial approach is to focus on the beauty of tech; it is one of the easiest ways to achieve a first-class ticket to the middle class and for this reason, I believe most should consider pursuing a career as a tech worker.\nBut just because this is the easiest and cheapest route to having a cushy high-paying job, doesn't mean it's a walk in the park. Just as tech can look like flexing hours to fit your schedule, it can also look like a stressful week of overtime with some days requiring you to work from 8 in the morning till 8 the next...\nSo here I am, writing an article on why you shouldn't pursue employment in the tech industry. Unfortunately, I'm familiar with people who got drawn in by the allure of programming only to discover after they've started that it wasn't what they thought it would be and had to bail out quickly. Sadly, some of these folks have spent a lot of money on coding boot camp training, just to be let go less than twelve months later due to their performance.\nGiven that, here are five reasons you might not want to work in tech.\n1. Long Hours - As mentioned before, tech jobs typically involve working long hours and can be quite stressful. Although many tech companies try to discourage employees from working overtime, it is often expected in order to stay competitive.\nThis kind of subtle pressure can come in the form of coworkers bragging about how much effort they put in over the weekend to finish their projects, even if such unpaid overtime was not officially approved. As time passes, the workload increases; coworkers push each other to finish the same amount of work in a shorter time frame, which can be impossible to do without working over forty hours.\n2. High Stress Levels - Working in technology can be highly stressful due to tight deadlines, pressure from clients or bosses, and high expectations from customers or other stakeholders. Besides acquiring the skills necessary to do your job, you're expected to quickly grasp incoming technical developments and spend time outside of work studying for potential certifications.\nIf you don't stay on top of your work in the tech industry, you'll quickly find yourself lagging behind. There will always be someone on your team who obsesses over their work around the clock, outshining the rest. They will likely be up at midnight perfecting their work, making everyone else's accomplishments look meager in comparison.\nIt's a double-edged sword. On one hand, the cutthroat atmosphere acts as a way of sifting through the least experienced developers. But on the flip side, the stressful environment can cause those with the least amount of ability to become overwhelmed and start to doubt themselves. If this culture doesn't sound appealing, you might want to reconsider a position in tech. This leads me to my next point...\n3. Low Job Security - Technology is ever-evolving which means that what you learned today may become obsolete tomorrow as new technologies emerge on the market. This can lead to job insecurity as you are always at risk of being replaced by someone who knows more than you do in a short period of time.\nSince I'm employed as a contractor, I need to be able to adapt my skills on the fly in order to fulfill each client's unique requirements. AI has only made this more pronounced so if you're not comfortable with that kind of instability, it might not be the best career path for you to pursue.\n4. High Costs - Tech related courses, certifications or boot camps often come with hefty costs that you'll be expected to invest in, which may not pay off if you later decide that this field isn't for you after all.\nAs I mentioned before, I've worked with people who graduated from expensive boot camps that they paid thousands for only to be fired after less than a year of work.\nGaining certifications isn’t always easy on the wallet. You must pay for each certification test, and if you don’t pass, you have to bear the cost of retaking the exam. Fortunately, some employers will reimburse successful candidates. But failure can still be quite an expensive setback.\n5. Ageism - Unfortunately, ageism is an issue in the tech industry as well where younger professionals often get preference over older individuals who may have more experience but lack the latest technical knowledge. This bias often results in employers overlooking older professionals for hiring and promotion opportunities which can cause frustration among those affected by ageism in the workplace.\nIt's hard to fight something that is hidden yet so prevalent. I've observed how older contractors are less likely to be chosen for projects than their younger counterparts. I even caught clients saying outright that they don't want to hire anyone over a certain age.\nIt's worth bearing in mind that if you are beyond a certain age and considering a switch to tech, this could be an issue. It is fairly noticeable, although not necessarily limited to the tech field.\nI don't wish to imply that it is impossible for the tech industry to change; only that its present culture demands assertiveness. Not everyone has an outspoken personality, so if you're not looking to cultivate one, it might be worth considering another field of work.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/04/five-reasons-why-applying-for-job-in.html","section":"post","tags":["Lifestyle"],"title":"Five Reasons Why Applying for a Job in Tech May Not Be Right for You"},{"body":"\rThe tech industry can be daunting, often evoking feelings of insecurity or questioning one's capacities. This is especially true for women and minorities who may experience even more alienation in this field due to any impolite remarks or animosity they may encounter in their surroundings.\nI strive to maintain a sense of autonomy in my relationships with others, rather than attempt to manipulate their behavior. I focus on how I can manage my own thoughts and actions in response to those around me, rather than try to control their decisions. By adopting this attitude, microaggressions will become easier to ignore.\nIn order to be successful as a woman in tech, it's important you keep this advice in mind: always remain true to yourself.\nAt some point, we have to ask ourselves if we really feel as if we're tapping into our full potential at work. I was surrounded by seasoned professionals who had been established in the industry longer than I had been alive.\nTheir sophisticated discourse intimidated and challenged me, but rather than being intimidated by the fact that I was the only woman in the room, I aimed to increase my knowledge of engineering and push my skills further. And there are empowering ways to developing your skillsets beyond aimlessly studying online or solving Hacker Rank problems. Try answering these questions:\n1. What do you do to stay motivated when things get tough?\n2. Are there any groups you can join or resources you can use to help further your development?\n3. How can you make yourself an asset in the workplace?\n4. What steps do you need to take to ensure that your voice is heard in the office?\n5. Are there any mentors who can help guide and support your progress?\n6. Is there a way for you to create a safe space for other women and minorities in tech?\n7. What advice do you have for other women and minorities who are trying to break into the tech field?\n8. What do you think is the most important skill or trait you need to succeed in tech?\n9. Are there any organizations or networks that provide resources and connections for women and minorities in the tech industry?\n10. How can you make sure that your work is seen and appreciated in the workplace?\nIf you find yourself vexed by these inquiries, then be truthful with yourself and explore roads for your individual evolution. That could be a fantastic point to begin or even revisit.\nFor me, I found myself pivoting away from traditional engineering activities into more creative ones. It was important to find ways to push myself and challenge my skillset, but also make sure I could still contribute to the team in a meaningful way.\nTo do this, I sought out mentorship, took on additional responsibilities outside of engineering (such as content creation or marketing), and explored new outlets for creativity. Additionally, I made sure to network with other minority professionals in tech, attend conferences focused on women in tech, and join diversity groups both online and in-person.\nThese experiences enabled me to create a unique skill set that allowed me stand out as an individual and not just another female engineer. Through these different avenues of growth, I was able to hone my technical proficiency while also developing soft skills that helped foster relationships with my colleagues. Ultimately, this enabled me to gain recognition for the value I provided.\nBy understanding ourselves better and having the courage to explore our unique interests, we can create an established presence within the tech industry that allows us to build our networks and build successful careers on our own terms.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/04/succeeding-as-woman-in-tech.html","section":"post","tags":["Lifestyle"],"title":"Achieve Your Goals as a Woman in Tech: 10 Essential Questions to Ask Yourself for Success in the Industry."},{"body":"As the demand for programmers with a deep understanding of business needs grows, one may ponder if AI could take the place of many jobs requiring programming-- yielding more efficient code in a much shorter amount of time than humans are capable of.\nI noticed this while I was having a discussion with a prospective employer. At the time, I wasn't on the hunt for something new, but it helps to freshen up your resume and evaluate yourself against the current industry standard.\nThe hiring manager seemed to value applicants with a good understanding of what customers wanted and strong communication capabilities more than just basic programming skills. This was because their technology had shifted away from coding, requiring developers to use tools that reduce the amount of effort and time required for programming to meet the desired business outcomes.\nThe advancements in AI technology have been quite remarkable in recent years. With machine learning, AI can now make software development significantly easier.\nThis technology can allow developers to write code faster and more effectively by automating parts of the code that would have taken hours or days for a human programmer to complete.\nSo I thought it would be wise to become knowledgeable in one of these technologies and try it out for myself. OpenAI Codex is an AI system that powers GitHub Copilot, a coding assistant service for prevalent IDE softwares such as VSCode. With the worry that there might eventually be a shortage of programming roles in the future, I figured this could help me stay ahead of the game.\nAI can detect bugs in code before they even become an issue, saving time and money. It can also be used to detect malicious code or security threats—skipping the time and effort of vulnerability remediation.\nAnd when combined with natural language processing, AI is even capable of understanding instructions given in natural language and then converting it into code that a computer will understand.\nIt is not an unrealistic assumption to think that in the future, machines could handle a lot of the labor-intensive tasks that programmers are currently doing by hand - all while being monitored by experienced personnel.\nThat's why I thought it would be good to become familiar with one of these technologies and try it out myself. I invite you to try these technologies along with me.\nAs in the words of Elon Musk: \u0026quot;if you can't beat them, join them\u0026quot;. If automation is what will help pay the bills in the future, then we should learn as much as we can about it. And there's no better reason to try this out than because OpenAI Codex is completely free!\nNow that we know the basics of AI, let's take a look at how it can be applied to our development tasks. AI can be used to optimize coding efficiency in a variety of ways, from task automation to helping improve existing code.\nOne way AI can help is by converting your comments into executable code. This means that the comments you put into your code can be automatically transformed into working code. This makes it easier to keep an overall understanding of the project while also reducing the time spent manually adding code.\nAdditionally, AI-powered tools like OpenAI Codex are also capable of completely rewriting your existing code in order to optimize performance or add new features. You provide the input and guidelines, and then Codex takes care of the rest.\nFor developers who are looking for additional support beyond simple automation, OpenAI Codex can also provide options for other libraries they can use to improve their existing code and make sure it’s running optimally.\nThis type of automation provides developers with more time that they would otherwise have spent debugging or writing tedious lines of code. It's an incredible technology and one that I'm excited to explore further!\nSo, here's something cool: Translating code from one language to another. I decided to give it a go and convert this function I wrote for a Pinterest bot app that I'm developing.\nfunc search(wd selenium.WebDriver) error {\n//\\n simulates a user pressing enter\nsearch := \u0026quot;breakfast\\n\u0026quot;\nxpath := \u0026quot;//*[@id=\\\u0026quot;searchBoxContainer\\\u0026quot;]/div/div/div[2]/input\u0026quot;\nwd.SetImplicitWaitTimeout(60000000000)\nsearchBar, err := wd.FindElement(selenium.ByXPATH, xpath)\nif err != nil {\nreturn err\n}\nsearchBar.SendKeys(search)\nfmt.Printf(\u0026quot;We were able to search\u0026quot;)\nreturn nil\n}\nIf only it worked...I guess this is to be expected because the AI isn't aware of the imports used for this application.\nSo, let's try something a bit more straight forward...\npackage main\nimport (\n\u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n)\nfunc main() {\nfmt.Sprintf(\u0026quot;this seems to work\u0026quot;)\ntest1(30)\n}\nfunc test1(x int) string {\nif x != 10 {\nreturn \u0026quot;This int is not 10\u0026quot;\n}\nreturn \u0026quot;This int is 10\u0026quot;\n}\nAnd after two attempts, it looks like it worked. Amazing...\nOpenAI has plenty of interesting features. Another is this Explain Code feature which seems to have a lot of potential, but it can take some time to get it working. This issue has more to do with the server acting wonky than the actual AI technology bugging out. I honestly think it did a pretty good job.\nWith the initial block of code from my selenium Pinterest bot, I received this output:\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Here's what the above class is doing: 1. We're creating a new webdriver 2. We're opening the browser 3. We're navigating to the website 4. We're searching for breakfast 5. We're closing the browser\nSure, we never executed steps 1,2, and 5, but at least the AI understands the gist of what's going on here.\nOverall, OpenAI Codex has been a great learning experience for me so far. With its advanced capabilities and free access, this tool has helped me gain a better understanding of natural language processing and code completion algorithms—all things that will become increasingly important in the future as more jobs are taken over by AI-driven automation.\nDoes this mean all of our jobs are in jeopardy? That our 6-figure cushy tech positions will be a thing of the past? I doubt it. As you can see, this technology is still in its infancy--requiring skilled professionals to manage and test it before any code can reach production.\nI do foresee this technology advancing to the point where the high demand for software engineers and the stereotypical nerd developer will diminish. Instead, there will be an increasing demand for creative thinkers to solve essential problems.\nBut on the bright side... Utilizing AI's processing power and data analysis capability may be the key to unlocking our collective intellect, allowing us to work together more effectively in solving some of humanity's most difficult challenges. Freeing up mental energy for creative problem-solving can be made possible by AI's powerful computing capabilities and its ability to quickly sift through large amounts of data.\nWith a long-term outlook on technology and work, we can find hope and optimism in finding solutions to complex issues while giving ourselves the chance to think outside the box and conduct experiments.\nAt the end of the day, OpenAI Codex is just another tool that can assist us in becoming better coders. It fills a gap between a programmer’s knowledge and their ability to solve complex problems—providing guidance when we need it most without taking away from our creativity or autonomous learning capabilities.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/03/exploring-openai-will-ai-kick-us-out-of.html","section":"post","tags":["tutorial","Programming Tutorial"],"title":"Exploring OpenAI —Will AI Kick us Out of the Job? "},{"body":"So, this is the first post of what I foresee to be an entire chapter of working with Go as it relates to remediating vulnerabilities. This particular post will focus on patching vulnerabilities related to Software Composition Analysis- an important task to perform regularly in order to avoid a lot of technical debt later on (Seriously, Handle it now!).\nPrograms are made up of numerous components--elements that can go unnoticed because many developers carelessly import dependencies without being aware of vulnerabilities that might exist within them.\nMany teams don't know the dangers of leaving software components vulnerable to attack or just don’t put enough emphasis on code analysis. In actuality, old or weak dependencies can lead to disastrously expensive consequences.\nThis is where a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scan can provide assistance. Through this process, we can detect potential vulnerabilities in open source packages, understand the reasons why a specific dependency is vulnerable, and potentially acquire directions for remediation.\nSCA is a process that uses automated tools to analyze the source code of an application and report any possible security-related vulnerabilities. This is one of the most important steps you can take as a developer to ensure your code and applications are secure from malicious attacks. SCA can also help identify common coding errors that lead to serious issues such as memory leaks, buffer overflows, and race conditions.\nBy running SCA, you’re able to detect flaws in dependencies before they’re deployed into production environments, allowing you to catch issues before they become a significant problem. Additionally, SCA helps maintain consistent quality and preserves trust for both you and your users.\nAt its core, SCA is all about improving security posture by not only scanning for potential vulnerabilities but also ensuring compliance with industry-standard regulations like GDPR or ISO/IEC 27001. By regularly running these tools on all of your applications and codebases, you can rest assured that your applications have been tested against these standards.\nAt first glance, SCA scanning might appear to be more intimidating than when working with other projects such as with maven dependency projects where excluding vulnerabilities within a parent dependency might appear to be more intuitive, but after working with Go for some time, I find it to be a lot easier to work with compared to maven projects.\nI was initially annoyed with the fact that the go mod graph command wasn't nearly as great as the command for getting a view of the dependency tree like with maven. Mostly because go mod graph practically just gives you what you can already see in the go.sum file.\nSo, the workaround for this is to either utilize tools such as deptree(GitHub - vc60er/deptree: show Golang dependence like tree) to uncover the parent dependency of a dependency of interest, or to create a script that essentially does the same thing.\nI find that deptree is a pretty good tool, but sometimes it doesn't work, so I settled with just building a script to find the parent of the dependency of interest.\nBut after spending time remediating vulnerabilities, I noticed it wasn't a huge deal considering the nature of Go. You don't have to know the parent dependency to exclude a dependency within it. You can actually directly exclude the child--which in some way feels less secure, but we'll get into that a little latter.\nIf you need to make use of a specific version of a dependency, you can specify the non-vulnerable version, while excluding all other versions of the same vulnerability.\nLet's say we're creating a selenium program with Go language. We've listed the selenium and semver parent dependencies in the go.mod. We can observe the bunch of dependencies associated with the parent dependencies in the go.sum. We can exclude the version of the xgbutil library from the go.sum and run go mod tidy in order to get the new version of it (if needed).\n1 2module main.go 3 4go 1.17 5 6 7require ( 8\tgithub.com/BurntSushi/xgbutil v0.0.0-20190907113008-ad855c713046 // indirect 9\tgithub.com/blang/semver v3.5.1+incompatible // indirect 10 github.com/tebeka/selenium v0.9.9 11) 12 13exclude github.com/BurntSushi/xgbutil v0.0.0-20160919175755-f7c97cef3b4e Thus, a few simple steps can secure the dependencies being utilized. I'm not claiming that I have the ultimate solution to this, as I'm still in the process of testing it out. But if it comes down to when a parent dependency needs a particular version of a child dependency and excluding that version of the child dependency would cause failures, then perhaps the best way to go about it would be to upgrade or downgrade the parent while the most unfavorable solution to this would be to find a new dependency and rework a portion of your application to ensure it remains secure.\nI will say that 80% of the time--even when working with Maven and Gradle projects--excluding the vulnerable child dependency will suffice. But I have dealt with annoying projects that forced me to update or find alternatives to nearly every parent dependency in the application and rework code to remediate vulnerabilities.\nBut I hope this article has helped you acquire a deeper understanding of SCA. The convenience of Go is incredible, but it does truly blow my mind how so many go devs(hobbyists and professionals) carelessly import dependencies into their applications without any regard for details that might exist within those packages. I actually came across this humorous article some time ago, which highlights why it's important for developers to be cognizant of the dependencies they import into their projects (including really popular ones). Although this example is pretty benign, imagine what else might be out there lingering in your codebase. By taking the right precautions, we can avoid costly errors and security breaches.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/03/diving-into-dependency-forest-with.html","section":"post","tags":["Programming","go","Go Security","Programming Tutorial"],"title":"Diving into the Dependency Forest with Golang"},{"body":"","link":"//localhost:1313/tags/Go-Security/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Go Security"},{"body":"\rAlthough some tech companies are pushing for workers to return to the office, many techies are embracing the work from home lifestyle. However, lifeless home offices can be dispiriting. Re-arranging and refreshing the atmosphere can help liven up the workspace. Why should we ignore our offices when we make time to decorate for holidays?\nYour workspace should be where your creativity comes to life! When you step in the door, you should be ready to conquer, innovate, connect, and manage. Your home office should be a place where you can be the star of your own show--the CEO in command of your personal universe--the head honcho in charge of your own world.\nHere are some tips to get your creative juices flowing and make your home office a space of upliftment and inspiration:\nNo Matter Your Style, Keep the Clutter Away! Clutter can sap your energy, so make sure to give everything a place and purpose when designing your workspace. Decorating your home office can help make it inviting while preventing distractions from superfluous items.\nConsider keeping items stored away neatly, like in labeled folders or on shelves. If you have desk accessories, organize them to avoid an eyesore. Sort out what you need and what you don't--too many knick-knacks can be distracting and make your room feel busy.\nOrganize your desk with drawers, compartments, and baskets for quick access to items like pens, notepads, and other necessities. Work more efficiently with wall organizers and wire baskets, keeping your work area clean and organized.\nWhen decorating, choose pieces that are aesthetically pleasing without causing distraction or eye fatigue. Opt for framed art prints or string lights for additional light during late nights.\nThink of using pieces that also serve as storage. I'm a fan of Japanese lamps for this purpose, since they can offer some extra room to store items and decorations.\nYour home office should reflect your personal style; however, be mindful of how much time you have to upkeep your workspace. Minimalist designs might be the best option if you're one who struggles to find the time to dust and reorganize often. Maximalist aesthetics look whimsical and beautiful but can become difficult to manage when you're not on top of it.\nExperiment with Fragrances Fragrance can influence one's emotions. Invest in some scented candles to establish a relaxing and sophisticated atmosphere. Consider lavender, bergamot, cedarwood, or sandalwood to keep you present. If the workplace has a window, light up a few incense sticks to increase tranquility.\nNatural oils are also perfect for giving the air around the workspace a gentle yet dynamic smell. But as a candle maker, I like to try different fragrances and spruce up my work area often with different candle scents. Though essential oil diffusers can be just as effective for providing an ambient aroma to the space, candles add an extra je ne sais quoi to set the mood. Whether dark academia or more minimalist design, a candle can truly make it come alive.\nWhen it comes to fragrance, remember that less is more—don't go overboard! A single candle or lightly scented essential oil diffuser will be just enough to make your space feel serene and inviting.\nBring in Some Greenery Plants are a great addition to any workspace: they look great and filter out toxins, while providing a calming presence. Low-maintenance options like spider plants, succulents, and bonsai trees require minimal watering and will thrive with indoor lighting.\nBut if you're someone like me who struggles to keep even the hardiest of plants alive, there are plenty of low-maintenance alternatives that can still bring a touch of greenery to your space. Considering they don't require water or sunlight, artificial plants can be perfect for people with a black thumb. You can also go for terrariums or wall gardens made up of preserved moss or succulents—they look beautiful and create an eye-catching display without any upkeep required.\nInvest In Comfort Just because the pink swivel chair is cute, doesn't mean you should impulse buy it. Your sitting area in your workspace is more than an accessory. Nobody wants to work with a sore back because their chair is cute but uncomfortable. Unfortunately, furniture that is both comfortable and aesthetically pleasing can be rather pricey, but your back with thank you for the investment in the future.\nPerhaps it's time to get creative! Have an old chair that's still good for sitting? Then add some chair cushions and voila, you've got yourself a designer look without the designer price tag!\nDon't Overlook the Perfect Lighting Forget ceiling fans! Whether you go for floor lamps or hanging pendants, you can create a cozy yet productive atmosphere in your workspace with the perfect kind of lighting. Consider avoiding those blinding overhead lights — they just add more strain to your eyes.\nFurthermore, a soft, flickering accent light like a candle can be a great addition to your office. If melting wax under a flame isn't your thing, faux candles or nightlights can bring the same cozy atmosphere. I came across these really cute mushroom night lights to give my workspace a more whimsical vibe. They look perfect during those rainy days or nights when you still want to sit in the dark.\nFind the Right Background Music to Set the Tone This is a big deal to me. I need background music that makes me feel like I can take over the world. As cringe as it may sound, I listen to Hans Zimmer Dark Knight soundtrack music while at the peak of my focus while programming. Don't be afraid to tap into that main character energy! Discover or build your own dark academia playlists for the times you'll likely be vigorously researching.\nMaybe you don't care to listen to music, or don't find it very stimulating. There are other soundscapes out there that can help you focus and stay productive. Have you ever heard of natural white noise? It's a type of ambient noise that can help blur out distracting noises and create an environment ideal for concentration.\nYou can find natural white noise recordings online, such as the sound of a crackling fire, rain on your roof or a running stream with bird calls in the background—all of which can be great for studying and wrapping up projects quickly. You may even want to try playing instrumental music at a low volume; sometimes this helps me focus because I'm not distracted by singing vocals.\nIt's all about trial and error, so don't be afraid to try something new! Who knows, it may end up being your new go-to workspace soundtrack!\nRemember to put intent and passion into the design of your workspace while updating your workspace as it relates to the shift of the seasons. We don’t forget to decorate our homes as the holidays come and go, but for some reason our office is left neglected. Working from home may give you a greater amount of freedom in regard to design, so why not take advantage of that?\nAdding some seasonal elements like wallpapers, art pieces, plants or holiday decorations can bring an element of fun and joy into your workspace. Get creative with references from past experiences that may have been special times for you in life. For example, if you had gone away on a beach vacation last summer, display a surfboard or even photos from that trip in your office space.\nShifting out old accents and exchanging them for something new often can help keep things fresh and exciting. Incorporate plants that make sense with the season such as tropical plants for summer and evergreen shrubbery for winter months. Consider replacing items like throw pillows or rugs with more appropriate pieces– like florals in spring or tartans in fall – adding a layer of warmth to your space.\nBy taking these steps, you can transform an ordinary home office into one that evokes feelings of joy while providing comfort and motivation during those long hours working remotely.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/03/a-simple-guide-to-customizing-your-tech.html","section":"post","tags":["Lifestyle"],"title":"A Simple Guide to Customizing Your Tech Workspace"},{"body":"Structs in Go programming are quite straightforward. You could liken them to Java model classes, but much simpler. Structs are used to represent physical or conceptual elements in the real world, they can be linked to one another, and they are not as lengthy as Java model classes...\nTake a glance at this example of some java model classes. We have a student class and an address class. As can be seen, there is a lot of work packed into this code -- numerous lines that could be condensed when compared to Python, Go, and JavaScript.\n1 2package Java_Example; 3import java.util.ArrayList; 4 5public class Student { 6 public String name; 7 public int age; 8 public String gender; 9 public ArrayList classes; 10 public Address addres; 11 12 public Student(String name, int age, String gender, ArrayList classes, Address addres) { 13 this.name = name; 14 this.age = age; 15 this.gender = gender; 16 this.classes = classes; 17 this.addres = addres; 18 } 19 20 21 public String getName() { 22 return this.name; 23 } 24 25 public void setName(String name) { 26 this.name = name; 27 } 28 29 public int getAge() { 30 return this.age; 31 } 32 33 public void setAge(int age) { 34 this.age = age; 35 } 36 37 public String getGender() { 38 return this.gender; 39 } 40 41 public void setGender(String gender) { 42 this.gender = gender; 43 } 44 45 public ArrayList getClasses() { 46 return this.classes; 47 } 48 49 public void setClasses(ArrayList classes) { 50 this.classes = classes; 51 } 52 53 public Address getAddres() { 54 return this.addres; 55 } 56 57 public void setAddres(Address addres) { 58 this.addres = addres; 59 } 60} 61 62 63package Java_Example; 64 65public class Address{ 66 public String street; 67 public int zipcode; 68 public String city; 69 70 71 72 public Address(String street, int zipcode, String city) { 73 this.street = street; 74 this.zipcode = zipcode; 75 this.city = city; 76 } 77 78 79 public String getStreet() { 80 return this.street; 81 } 82 83 public void setStreet(String street) { 84 this.street = street; 85 } 86 87 public int getZipcode() { 88 return this.zipcode; 89 } 90 91 public void setZipcode(int zipcode) { 92 this.zipcode = zipcode; 93 } 94 95 public String getCity() { 96 return this.city; 97 } 98 99 public void setCity(String city) { 100 this.city = city; 101 } 102} Go shuns the conventional object-oriented approach that most languages embrace, although it has the O-O moniker attached to it. Don't be fooled though, it won't be providing any class-object architecture like its contemporaries. Instead, structs can be used to aggregate compound data into neat little collections.\nStructs in Go programming are a way to create custom data types. They are used to define the characteristics of each type and can contain various types of data, including other structs as members. They provide a way to organize related data into a single object, and they can be further customized by using tags to label fields with additional information. Structs are useful in applications where large amounts of data need to be kept organized in an efficient manner.\nLet's delve further into this concept. For instance, a data structure for a Student object could look like this:\n1type Student struct { 2\tName string 3\tAge int 4\tGender string 5\tClasses []string 6} The type keyword is used to declare a Struct, followed by the name of the Struct and then a set of curly braces {} .The Name, Age, Gender, and Classes fields represent the data associated with a student. The ‘[]string’ declares an array of strings to store classes taken by the student. As mentioned above, structs can also contain other structs as members. For example, if a Student has an Address field within it, you can write it like this:\n1 2type Student struct { 3\tName string 4\tAge int 5\tGender string 6\tClasses []string 7\tAddress Address 8} 9 10type Address struct { 11\tStreet string 12\tZipcode int 13\tCity string 14} Structs provide an efficient way to organize related data into a single object and give developers more control over how data is structured. Struct tags may also be used to label fields with additional information. This makes structs extremely useful in applications where large amounts of data need to be kept organized in an efficient manner.\n1 2type Student struct { 3\tName string `json:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;` 4\tAge int `json:\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;` 5\tGender string `json:\u0026#34;gender\u0026#34;` 6\tClasses []string `json:\u0026#34;classes\u0026#34;` 7\tAddress `json:\u0026#34;address\u0026#34;` 8\tMisc 9} 10 11type Address struct { 12\tStreet string `json:\u0026#34;street\u0026#34;` 13\tZipcode int `json:\u0026#34;zipcode\u0026#34;` 14\tCity string `json:\u0026#34;city\u0026#34;` 15} As Structs become more complex, they may require additional functions to manipulate the data fields. Go provides a way to attach functions to Structs as methods, which are similar to Java methods. Methods are a way to group related operations together and make them more convenient to use and can be used to provide additional functionality to Structs.\nIt's simple to attach operations to structs, like in the illustration below.\nHere, we add a function that creates a unified address string from the individual address parameters.\nAs you can see, structs are simple enough. Far simpler than the Java example I presented earlier. Golang is one of those languages that you can quickly and easily dive into, but a good programmer is left wondering if they are writing code in the most effective and efficient way possible.\nSo, let's review what should be avoided when dealing with structs. Have a glance at this nested struct.\n1 2type StudentNested struct { 3 Name string `json:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;` 4 Age int `json:\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;` 5 Gender string `json:\u0026#34;gender\u0026#34;` 6 Classes []string `json:\u0026#34;classes\u0026#34;` 7 Address struct { 8 Street string `json:\u0026#34;street\u0026#34;` 9 Zipcode int `json:\u0026#34;zipcode\u0026#34;` 10 City string `json:\u0026#34;city\u0026#34;` 11 } `json:\u0026#34;address\u0026#34;` 12} At first glance, this struct may not seem like a big problem, but once we start nesting structs within one another, things become quite complex. It is hard to read through and can be quite difficult to manage when trying to create an instance of a struct.\nIn the case that you don't have the same param name within a nested struct, you can instantiate the struct and call a value within it in a much simpler way like so:\n1 2package main 3 4import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; 5 6type Student struct { 7 Name string `json:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;` 8 Age int `json:\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;` 9 Gender string `json:\u0026#34;gender\u0026#34;` 10 Classes []string `json:\u0026#34;classes\u0026#34;` 11 Address `json:\u0026#34;address\u0026#34;` 12} 13 14type Address struct { 15 Street string `json:\u0026#34;street\u0026#34;` 16 Zipcode int `json:\u0026#34;zipcode\u0026#34;` 17 City string `json:\u0026#34;city\u0026#34;` 18} 19 20type StudentNested struct { 21 Name string `json:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;` 22 Age int `json:\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;` 23 Gender string `json:\u0026#34;gender\u0026#34;` 24 Classes []string `json:\u0026#34;classes\u0026#34;` 25 Address struct { 26 Street string `json:\u0026#34;street\u0026#34;` 27 Zipcode int `json:\u0026#34;zipcode\u0026#34;` 28 City string `json:\u0026#34;city\u0026#34;` 29 } `json:\u0026#34;address\u0026#34;` 30} 31 32func main() { 33 34 address := Address{ 35 \u0026#34;random\u0026#34;, 36 555675, 37 \u0026#34;City\u0026#34;, 38 } 39 s1 := Student{ 40 \u0026#34;Brian\u0026#34;, 41 20, 42 \u0026#34;Male\u0026#34;, 43 []string{\u0026#34;Org Chem\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Calc\u0026#34;}, 44 address, 45 } 46 s2 := StudentNested{ 47 \u0026#34;Brian\u0026#34;, 48 20, 49 \u0026#34;Male\u0026#34;, 50 []string{\u0026#34;Org Chem\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Calc\u0026#34;}, 51 Address{ 52 \u0026#34;random\u0026#34;, 53 555675, 54 \u0026#34;City\u0026#34;, 55 }, 56 } 57 fmt.Println(s1.City) 58 fmt.Println(s2.Address.City) 59} In the above example, you can see that we create two separate structs: a nested and an embedded struct. Instead of defining the embedded Address param in the embedded struct, we just set the Address param without specifying the type. This makes it possible to directly call the city value from our s1 instance rather than calling the instance, then the Address to eventually get the city value as shown in s2.\nBut be cautious with the parameter titles when striving to access an element from an instance--when trying to obtain the address value from Misc-- a runtime mistake occurs because the compiler initially looks for the address struct param in Student rather than the Address param in Misc. To obtain the expected address string, one should type s1.Misc.Address.\nBut I have also discovered this as a means to check if we are repeatedly inputting the same data in a code structure, which could lead to an increase in size and memory utilization. To prevent this from happening, someone might choose to employ inheritance in the code instead of creating a different Address string, like the student struct using the Address struct in order to reuse its parameters. The programmer might also decide that including the Misc param is needlessly cluttering up the code base.\nUsing Struct Tags\nStruct tags are key-value pairs which are used to customize the behavior of structs. Struct tags are placed after certain fields in a struct, and they can be used to control how data is parsed and stored. They can also be used to change the name of the field when serializing or deserializing data, as well as customizing which type the field should be converted into (e.g. an int field could be converted into a string).\nFor example, if we wanted to change the way our Student struct looked when serialized, we could use a struct tag like so:\n1 2type Student struct { 3 Name string `json:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;` 4 Age int `json:\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;` 5 Gender string `json:\u0026#34;gender\u0026#34;` 6 Classes []string `json:\u0026#34;classes\u0026#34;` 7 Address `json:\u0026#34;address\u0026#34; tag:\u0026#34;AddressInfo\u0026#34;` 8} The \u0026quot;tag\u0026quot; field in this case indicates that we want the Address field to have a different name when it is serialized, in this case \u0026quot;AddressInfo\u0026quot;. This would result in our JSON object looking something like this:\n1 2{ 3 Name: \u0026#34;Brian\u0026#34;, 4 Age: 20, 5 Gender: \u0026#34;Male\u0026#34;, 6 Classes: [\u0026#34;Org Chem\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Calc\u0026#34;], 7 AddressInfo: { 8 Street: \u0026#34;random\u0026#34;, 9 Zipcode: 555675, 10 City: City 11 } 12} As you can see, we have successfully changed our Address field from simply \u0026quot;Address\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;AddressInfo\u0026quot;. Struct tags are incredibly useful for customizing your structures and making them more readable both when instantiating and when using them with external APIs.\nSo, let's review what we've learned.\n1. Reduce Nested Structs\nNesting structs within a struct can quickly become unmanageable, especially with more complex data structures. To avoid this, try to flatten the data structure as much as possible. This can be done by moving related fields from nested structs out into the parent struct, or by combining multiple fields into one field. For example, instead of having a nested Address struct with Street, Zipcode and City fields, you could combine those three fields into one Address field. This will reduce nesting and make it easier to read and understand your code.\n2. Avoid Unnecessary Copies\nWhen dealing with structs, it is important to avoid unnecessary copies of data that are not needed. If a struct has too many copies of the same data, this can cause performance issues in your application since each copy needs to be allocated in memory and managed individually. Try to limit copying of structs and other data types where possible.\n3. Attach Functions to Structs When Necessary\nStructs are incredibly powerful data types that can be used to store and organize complex data. One way to further enhance their usefulness is to attach functions to them when necessary. This allows us to add additional operations that work directly on the struct and its fields without having to pass any additional parameters into the function. We no longer have to worry about passing an instance of a struct before calling a function, making writing code much simpler because there is less complexity involved; instead of remembering which parameters need to be passed in and what each parameter represents, all we need to do is call the function on an instance of a struct and it will return the desired output.\nAttaching functions directly to structures also encourages better organization. By keeping functions specific to a certain structure grouped together, they are easier for other developers or yourself down the road to find and understand what they do without searching through multiple files and directories. This leads to faster development times as well as less potential bugs due to confusion over what functions actually do or how they interact with different objects.\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/03/walkthrough-of-golang-structs.html","section":"post","tags":["tutorial","go","Programming Tutorial"],"title":"Walkthrough Of Golang Structs"},{"body":" The concept of idempotency will creep up regularly in your programming career, so it's essential to understand what it is and the significance. Plenty of programmers have passively heard the term--and may have even dropped it from time to time themselves--but many still have little to no idea as to what it means.\nIdempotency encompasses a peculiar notion: no matter how many times something is repeated, the result is always the same. It can appear in the form of mathematical equations, algorithms or abstract data structures, but in any case, the theorems remain the same.\nDespite its ubiquity, few of us fully grasp the concept behind idempotency; rather, it is more an intuitive understanding, an implicit acknowledgement of its existence. And yet, the sheer power of this concept is profound, for it is responsible for so much of programming. For example, when we update a complex system, idempotency ensures that we don't break the program by running the same function twice. Likewise, it is a fundamental part of the reliability and robustness of a program.\nBecause of its ubiquitous nature, idempotency is language-agnostic--meaning the concept is the same no matter the language in use. It can be used to create efficient code or streamline the testing process of a program. Ultimately, no matter the implementation, its efficacy will remain the same: no matter how many times we repeat a certain action, the result will always be the same.\nTo illustrate how this works in practice, consider the following example: a programmer might want to calculate the average of all elements in an array. To do so, they would apply the same method multiple times: summing up all elements and then dividing by the number of elements. As long as this operation is performed in the same way each time, the answer will always remain consistent no matter how many times it is repeated; thus, demonstrating idempotency.\n1package main 2 3import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; 4 5func main() { 6\tarray := [5]int{1, 5, 6, 7, 7} 7\tfmt.Println(average(array)) 8} 9 10func average(array [5]int) int { 11\tnum := 1 12\tfor _, val := range array { 13\tnum = num * val 14\t} 15\treturn num / len(array) 16} In mathematics an idempotent operation is when you can take the absolute value of a number, and then you take the absolute value of number again, and still get the same result both times (example below). Unlike with programming where operations are done over data structures stored in memory, math-idempotence only applies to functions of one parameter where the parameter type and return type are both numbers. In other words, the literal meaning of idempotency is \u0026quot;of the same power,\u0026quot; derived from the Latin idem, meaning same, and Old French potence, meaning power.\nE.g.: f(x) = f(f(x)).\nA prime example is a matrix, where the square root of any given value is equal to itself. This idea can be used to solve many problems in mathematics and engineering, including optimization and regression analysis.\nOne way to understand idempotency more clearly is to consider an example from everyday life. Suppose you are tasked with finding the average temperature of a room. To do so, you could take readings from each corner of the room and then divide by four. No matter how many times you compute the average temperature (assuming the room stays at a constant temperature), your result will remain unchanged - you can be sure that your calculation is idempotent!\nFunctional Idempotence refers to when a function can be called multiple times with the same parameters, and the result will always be the same. For example, using an ‘if’ statement twice with the same condition will yield the same result each time. After the first execution, all subsequent executions are the same.\n1 2import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; 3 4func main() { 5\tfmt.Println(check(10)) 6} 7 8func check(val int) string { 9 10\tif val == 5 { 11\treturn \u0026#34;This will always be the same if val == 5\u0026#34; 12\t} else { 13\treturn \u0026#34;This will always be the same if val != 5\u0026#34; 14\t} 15} Idempotence is important for creating reliable applications, as it ensures that different parts of code will not interfere with each other in unexpected ways. As such, it is important to understand what types of operations are idempotent before writing code so that you can design your program accordingly.\nThe concept of idempotency is important in web application development and web services. In particular, it applies to the concept of HTTP requests, as it helps ensure that a request will yield the same result regardless of how many times it is sent.\nWhen talking about HTTP requests, there are 8 HTTP methods, but we can focus on three simple ones: GET, PUT and POST.\nGET requests are designed to retrieve data from a server without modifying any state. This means that no matter how many times you send the same GET request, you should always get the same result. This is because a GET request does not modify any user data; instead, it just retrieves data from the server. You might not have even triggered a GET request, and the result would still be the same. Because of this, GET requests aren't technically idempotent but rather nullipotent.\nNullipotence is when there is an execution with essentially no side-effects. Like in the HTTP GET request example, there is no modification to the data, you are just getting the resource without effecting the database.\nPUT requests are designed to send data to a server to update specific data within a database. You can send the same request multiple times, but after the initial PUT request, the result will be the same.\nPOST requests are different in that they are used to send data to a server and modify user data or state on the server. The response to a POST request change depending on what you send; this means that if you send the same POST request multiple times, it may not yield the same result twice. For example, if you send a POST request to add an item to your shopping cart twice, then you would expect two items in your cart afterwards – not one! As such, POST requests are not functionally idempotent as they can have varying results depending on when they’re sent.\nIt’s important for developers to understand both functional and non-functional idempotence when designing their applications and writing code so that they can build reliable systems with predictable outcomes. It allows developers to make sure their systems work correctly under many different scenarios without having to spend a lot of time debugging potential issues caused by redundant operations. It also helps ensure that certain types of operations are guaranteed to have a consistent effect regardless of how many times they are called (e.g.: creating/updating/deleting records).\n","link":"//localhost:1313/2023/02/understanding-idempotency-newbies-guide.html","section":"post","tags":["Programming","Programming Tutorial"],"title":"Understanding Idempotency – A Newbies Guide to Secure Development"},{"body":"About Us Our Mission At Tech Debt Crew, we bridge the gap between technology and marketing to help businesses thrive in the digital era.
