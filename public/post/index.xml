      <description>I noticed that many of us don&#39;t seem to have a sound understanding of blockchain and its associated technologies. As a programmer in the financial tech sector, I must admit that my knowledge of blockchain and crypto was only superficial. We could all name bitcoin and NFTs, but most people aren&#39;t well informed about the reasons why blockchain is an essential tech trend. That&#39;s why this article is being written to explain what makes blockchain so important and why YOU should look into it beyond digital currencies and non-fungible tokens.</description>

      <description>Entering the realm of technology is not for the faint-hearted or those who hold their egos above all else. This assertion is made with the utmost sincerity because in this dynamic domain, you&#39;ll find yourself confronted with more questions than certainties. Every day, as the sun rises, my mind is ablaze with inquiries - inquiries that pertain to unraveling a perplexing bug, diving into an unfamiliar framework at a client&#39;s request, or acquainting myself with a new programming language essential for a project&#39;s completion by week&#39;s end.</description>

      <description>Hugo&#xD;The web development framework Hugo isn&#39;t well-known, but it&#39;s a powerful alternative to Angular or React. Backed by the Go programming language, Hugo grants developers dynamic abilities for building sites and apps.&#xA;My interest in Hugo began because: one, I&#39;m curious about learning new technologies; and two, I&#39;m not quite sure why developers, who are simply creating content-focused websites, choose to use Angular or React over Hugo.&#xA;Surely, having a website that is created in real-time is too complex and leads to slower load speeds than websites made with static elements.</description>

      <description>Competing with AI - What Steps to Take as Artificial Intelligence Advances&#xD;No one needs to be reminded that artificial intelligence (AI) is growing increasingly powerful and intimidating. Companies such as Wendy&#39;s already want to use AI in place of humans to carry out certain tasks.&#xA;Eventually, this could lead to a massive recession in white-collar jobs, leaving many people asking how they can compete with something that never sleeps, never takes a break or requests a raise, and works around the clock.</description>

      <description>The idea of using Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure has gained popularity in the tech industry. It enables developers to use a single configuration language to describe and provision resources across multiple cloud providers -- a time-saving measure that makes it easier to support multiple regions and cloud environments from a single platform.&#xA;But while Terraform provides a robust solution for streamlining the process of setting up and managing cloud resources, testing components of the setup is often neglected.</description>

My approach to learning was to craft projects that made technology relevant and exciting for me. Reading books and taking courses will only get you so far; the rest is all self-driven. This is how bots and data scraping caught my attention. Programming became more than a job - it became an art form.</description>

      <description>At a recent tech meeting, the idea of functional programming was brought up- a concept that I had only a shallow understanding of.&#xA;&amp;quot;What&#39;s functional programming?&amp;quot; someone asked. No one wanted to expound on it, so another person timidly suggested, &amp;quot;I guess it means the program has no side effects?&amp;quot; - disregarding that applications written in languages such as Pascal or Scala still generate some kind of result.&#xA;It became obvious that most people in the group didn&#39;t have an extensive knowledge of functional programming.</description>

      <description>I find it concerning when people join online forums and discuss how to get a tech job without needing to ever touch code or have a degree in computer science, IT, or any other related field.&#xA;It only serves to make it tougher for those people who don&#39;t possess the diploma, but are serious about gaining experience, to be taken seriously.

This is especially true for women and minorities who may experience even more alienation in this field due to any impolite remarks or animosity they may encounter in their surroundings.&#xA;I strive to maintain a sense of autonomy in my relationships with others, rather than attempt to manipulate their behavior. I focus on how I can manage my own thoughts and actions in response to those around me, rather than try to control their decisions.</description>

      <description>As the demand for programmers with a deep understanding of business needs grows, one may ponder if AI could take the place of many jobs requiring programming-- yielding more efficient code in a much shorter amount of time than humans are capable of.&#xA;I noticed this while I was having a discussion with a prospective employer. At the time, I wasn&#39;t on the hunt for something new, but it helps to freshen up your resume and evaluate yourself against the current industry standard.</description>

This particular post will focus on patching vulnerabilities related to Software Composition Analysis- an important task to perform regularly in order to avoid a lot of technical debt later on (Seriously, Handle it now!).&#xA;Programs are made up of numerous components--elements that can go unnoticed because many developers carelessly import dependencies without being aware of vulnerabilities that might exist within them.</description>
