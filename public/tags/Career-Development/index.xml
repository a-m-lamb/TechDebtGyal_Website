      <description>Entering the realm of technology is not for the faint-hearted or those who hold their egos above all else. This assertion is made with the utmost sincerity because in this dynamic domain, you&#39;ll find yourself confronted with more questions than certainties. Every day, as the sun rises, my mind is ablaze with inquiries - inquiries that pertain to unraveling a perplexing bug, diving into an unfamiliar framework at a client&#39;s request, or acquainting myself with a new programming language essential for a project&#39;s completion by week&#39;s end.</description>

      <description>This post speaks to those who have a drive for software engineering but do not have a degree in computer science or any associated area. Increasingly, more people are coming to the realization that programming can be learned independently, and a career can be attained by anyone with the diligence to figure it out, even without an academic background in the subject.&#xA;I had an interesting conversation with a group of peers on this topic recently.</description>

      <description>Hugo&#xD;The web development framework Hugo isn&#39;t well-known, but it&#39;s a powerful alternative to Angular or React. Backed by the Go programming language, Hugo grants developers dynamic abilities for building sites and apps.&#xA;My interest in Hugo began because: one, I&#39;m curious about learning new technologies; and two, I&#39;m not quite sure why developers, who are simply creating content-focused websites, choose to use Angular or React over Hugo.&#xA;Surely, having a website that is created in real-time is too complex and leads to slower load speeds than websites made with static elements.</description>

But has this made life easier?&#xA;I thought to myself, &amp;quot;Now I&#39;ll have the time to explore passions I couldn&#39;t before&amp;quot;. And, so far, it&#39;s proven to be true. I&#39;ve gotten into gardening, playing the piano, learning new languages, and digging deeper into philosophy.</description>

      <description>Competing with AI - What Steps to Take as Artificial Intelligence Advances&#xD;No one needs to be reminded that artificial intelligence (AI) is growing increasingly powerful and intimidating. Companies such as Wendy&#39;s already want to use AI in place of humans to carry out certain tasks.&#xA;Eventually, this could lead to a massive recession in white-collar jobs, leaving many people asking how they can compete with something that never sleeps, never takes a break or requests a raise, and works around the clock.</description>
