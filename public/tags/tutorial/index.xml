      <description>The idea of using Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure has gained popularity in the tech industry. It enables developers to use a single configuration language to describe and provision resources across multiple cloud providers -- a time-saving measure that makes it easier to support multiple regions and cloud environments from a single platform.&#xA;But while Terraform provides a robust solution for streamlining the process of setting up and managing cloud resources, testing components of the setup is often neglected.</description>

      <description>When I was just starting out in programming, I wanted to work on projects that were more stimulating. My approach to learning was to craft projects that made technology relevant and exciting for me. Reading books and taking courses will only get you so far; the rest is all self-driven. This is how bots and data scraping caught my attention. Programming became more than a job - it became an art form.</description>

      <description>As the demand for programmers with a deep understanding of business needs grows, one may ponder if AI could take the place of many jobs requiring programming-- yielding more efficient code in a much shorter amount of time than humans are capable of.&#xA;I noticed this while I was having a discussion with a prospective employer. At the time, I wasn&#39;t on the hunt for something new, but it helps to freshen up your resume and evaluate yourself against the current industry standard.</description>

      <title>Walkthrough Of Golang Structs</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/2023/03/walkthrough-of-golang-structs.html</link>

      <description>Structs in Go programming are quite straightforward. You could liken them to Java model classes, but much simpler. Structs are used to represent physical or conceptual elements in the real world, they can be linked to one another, and they are not as lengthy as Java model classes...&#xA;Take a glance at this example of some java model classes. We have a student class and an address class. As can be seen, there is a lot of work packed into this code -- numerous lines that could be condensed when compared to Python, Go, and JavaScript.</description>
